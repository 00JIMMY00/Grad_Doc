## 1. Introduction

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an emerging approach in artificial intelligence that combines a **retrieval** mechanism with a **generation** mechanism to produce more accurate and context-aware responses. Instead of relying purely on an Large Language Model’s internal knowledge (which may be limited or outdated), a RAG system **augments** the model’s input with relevant information retrieved from an external knowledge source. This graduation project focuses on designing and implementing a local RAG-based question-answering system. The system is “local” in the sense that it can be self-hosted and operate on a custom database of documents, rather than relying on proprietary cloud services for knowledge storage. The project’s repository (hosted on GitHub as **FCAI\_RAG**) provides the implementation code and configuration for this RAG system.

In this introductory section, we outline the background and context that motivated the project, clearly state the problem it addresses, and provide an overview of the implemented solution. We also briefly summarize the system’s key components and capabilities to set the stage for the detailed sections that follow.

### 1.1. Background and Context

Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and Gemini have demonstrated an impressive ability to generate human-like text and answer questions. However, they are inherently limited to the data they were trained on and can suffer from **hallucinations** – confident-sounding but incorrect statements. As organizations and individuals seek to apply LLMs to specialized domains or private datasets, two major challenges arise:

* **Knowledge Limitations:** An LLM cannot know facts or data added after its training cutoff, nor details specific to a company’s internal documents if those were never in its training set. For example, a model might not accurately answer questions about a new policy document or an unpublished research paper.
* **Accuracy and Trust:** Even when an LLM attempts to answer, it might produce plausible but incorrect information (hallucinations) or be unable to cite sources for its statements. In high-stakes domains (medical, legal, enterprise data) this is unacceptable without verification.

To overcome these issues, the AI community introduced **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** around 2020 as a framework to give LLMs access to external knowledge bases. In RAG, when a user asks a question, the system first performs a **retrieval step**: searching a collection of documents for relevant information. The retrieved text (such as paragraphs or “chunks” from documents) is then provided to the LLM along with the original query. This additional context “grounds” the LLM’s answer in factual references. It’s analogous to an “open-book exam” where the model can refer to a book (the documents) instead of relying solely on memory. The result is a more accurate and up-to-date response, often with source citations, increasing the answer’s trustworthiness.

In recent years, RAG has gained significance as a technique to build intelligent assistants and QA systems on private data (company knowledge bases, personal notes, academic literature, etc.). Tech companies and open-source communities have created tools to facilitate RAG, including vector databases for efficient similarity search and APIs for high-quality embeddings. This project builds on these advances by creating a small-scale but end-to-end RAG system that can be run locally. It leverages a **PostgreSQL** database with the **pgvector** extension as the document store, uses **embedding models** to encode textual data into vectors for semantic search, and integrates with large language models (via **Google’s Gemini API** or a local model like **DeepSeek** R1) to generate answers. The chosen technologies situate this project at the intersection of natural language processing, information retrieval, and software engineering for AI applications.

### 1.2. Problem Statement

The problem addressed by this project is the need for a **question-answering system that can provide accurate, source-backed answers from a custom document corpus, without requiring online access to external LLM services**. In many scenarios, one might have a collection of documents (PDFs, manuals, articles) and wish to query them in natural language. Traditional search engines or keyword-based databases are insufficient for such semantic querying, and fine-tuning an LLM on the documents can be expensive or impractical. How can we enable a generative AI to utilize specific **local data** to answer user queries, while maintaining correctness and the ability to show supporting evidence?

Concretely, the project targets the following issues:

* **Inability of Standard LLMs to Use Private Knowledge:** Out-of-the-box LLMs do not have access to a user’s private or proprietary documents. If asked about details in those documents, they either guess or fail. The problem is how to inject the content of those documents into the answer generation process, dynamically and efficiently.
* **Local Deployment Constraints:** Many available solutions for RAG rely on cloud-based vector stores or LLM APIs. For sensitive data, a local (on-premise) solution is preferred. The challenge is to design the system such that it can run on a personal or enterprise server, using local infrastructure and minimal external calls. This includes selecting appropriate tools that have self-hosted options (e.g., using PostgreSQL as a vector store instead of a cloud service).
* **System Integration Complexity:** Implementing RAG means integrating multiple components – data ingestion pipelines, vector indexing, similarity search algorithms, and LLM inference – into one cohesive system. The problem includes orchestrating these components efficiently and ensuring they work together within a real-time query workflow.

In summary, the project’s problem statement is: *“How can we build a locally hosted question answering system that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation to accurately answer questions using information from a given set of documents, ensuring that the answers are based on up-to-date and verifiable content?”* By solving this, the project aims to enable trustworthy AI assistance for domain-specific queries, even in environments where data privacy or lack of internet connectivity preclude using online services.

### 1.3. Overview of Solution (Local RAG System)

The solution developed is a **Local RAG Question-Answering Application**. At a high level, the system works as follows:

* **Document Knowledge Base:** We maintain a collection of documents (the knowledge source) in a PostgreSQL database. Each document is broken down into manageable chunks, and each chunk is stored along with its semantic vector embedding. The use of pgvector (PostgreSQL’s vector extension) allows similarity search over these embeddings directly via SQL queries.
* **Retrieval Module:** When a user poses a question (query), the system generates an embedding for the query (using the same embedding model used for documents). It then performs a vector similarity search in the database to retrieve the most relevant document chunks. This acts as the “open book” for the LLM – providing context that likely contains the answer.
* **Generation Module:** The retrieved text chunks are then combined with the user’s query to form an augmented prompt. This prompt is passed to a Large Language Model (LLM) which generates the final answer. In our implementation, we have integrated support for two types of LLMs: (a) an external API (Google’s Gemini model via the Gemini API) for high-quality large-model inference, and (b) a local LLM (DeepSeek R1, running via an Ollama server) for an entirely self-contained setup. The LLM’s response is expected to incorporate the provided context, thereby yielding an answer that is grounded in the content of the documents.
* **Frontend Interface:** The system includes a simple web-based user interface (a frontend web application) through which users can input questions and view answers. This interface communicates with the backend (FastAPI server) via RESTful calls. It is primarily a convenience for demonstration – the focus of the project is the backend RAG pipeline – but it makes the QA system interactive and user-friendly.
* **Local Deployment:** All components can be run in a local environment or local network. The database (PostgreSQL) and the FastAPI application can be containerized using Docker for ease of deployment. Because the solution can use a local LLM and local database, it is feasible to run the entire stack offline (after initial setup) – addressing use cases where internet access is restricted or data must remain on-premises for compliance.

In essence, the solution operationalizes the RAG concept: it **embeds documents into a vector store, retrieves relevant information on-demand, and feeds it to an LLM to produce answers**. By doing so, it ensures that the answers are both **accurate** (pulled from a trusted knowledge source) and **contextual** (leveraging the generative power of LLMs). Figure 4.1 in the System Architecture section will illustrate how these components interact within the system.

The remainder of this documentation is organized as follows: Section 2 provides theoretical background on RAG and related concepts (embeddings, transformers, vector databases). Section 3 states the project’s objectives and the motivation for choosing a local RAG approach, including expected use cases. Section 4 describes the system architecture in detail, including diagrams of the pipeline and explanations of each component. Section 5 enumerates the technology stack and tools used (FastAPI, PostgreSQL/pgvector, Cohere API, Gemini API, etc.), explaining why each was chosen and how they fit into the project’s structure. In Section 6, we walk through the codebase structure and main modules of the implementation, mapping directories and files to their functionality. Section 7 delves into the main processes (document ingestion, vector generation/storage, query processing) with pseudocode and narrative explanations. Section 8 covers project management aspects such as timeline, team roles, and challenges encountered during development. Section 9 suggests future improvements and extensions to the system (e.g., better retrieval algorithms, scaling considerations, multi-modal capabilities). Finally, Section 10 concludes the report. Appendices are provided for a glossary of terms, list of figures/tables, and a bibliography of references used.

By the end of this document, the reader should have a comprehensive understanding of what was built, how it works, and why certain design decisions were made, all in the context of modern AI practices for retrieval-augmented generation.

## 2. Theoretical Background

*This section provides a brief theoretical foundation for the concepts underlying the project. It covers the concept and significance of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the role of embeddings and similarity search in enabling semantic retrieval, a note on transformers as the backbone of modern LLMs, and an overview of vector databases. The aim is to familiarize the reader with these terms and ideas, facilitating a deeper understanding of the design and choices in later sections. (Given that this is a project report in computer science, we will keep the theoretical discussion concise and relevant.)*

### 2.1. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) – Concept and Significance

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** refers to a class of AI systems or techniques that integrate an information retrieval step into the text generation process of an LLM. In a traditional question-answering scenario with a standalone LLM, the model tries to answer based solely on its internal knowledge (parameters) which, as noted, can be outdated or incomplete. RAG introduces an explicit retrieval of external knowledge just-in-time for each query.

In practice, a RAG system performs two main steps for each user query:

1. **Retrieval:** Search a knowledge source (like a database of documents, or the web) for pieces of text related to the query. This is typically done by semantic search (using embeddings; see Section 2.2) or keyword search or a combination. The output is a set of relevant text passages, documents, or data entries. These serve as factual grounding for the next step.
2. **Generation:** Construct an input prompt that includes the user’s question and the retrieved text, and feed this into a generative model (LLM). The LLM then produces an answer that is expected to be conditioned on the provided text, thereby “augmenting” its generation with external information.

This approach is significant for several reasons:

* **Improved Accuracy:** By providing the LLM with real, up-to-date content related to the query, RAG systems greatly reduce the incidence of hallucinations and incorrect answers. The model’s output can be checked against the supplied reference text, increasing trust.
* **Dynamic Knowledge Updating:** Unlike fine-tuning an LLM on new data (which is time-consuming and static), a RAG system can be updated simply by adding new documents to the knowledge base. The retrieval component will then pull in those new facts when relevant. This ensures the system can handle evolving information without retraining the core model.
* **Source Attribution:** Users and developers often want to know *why* the model gave a certain answer. RAG makes it possible to show the source passages that led to the answer (because those passages were retrieved explicitly). This traceability fosters user confidence and allows verification of the model’s claims.
* **Data Privacy and Specialization:** RAG allows leveraging private or domain-specific data that was never part of the public training corpus of the LLM. For enterprises, this means they can deploy powerful AI assistants on their proprietary documentation without exposing that data to external services. The LLM essentially becomes capable of conversing about information it was never originally trained on, by virtue of retrieving that information at query time.

To illustrate, consider an LLM asked about the *latest internal financial report* of a company. A non-RAG approach might result in the model guessing or saying it doesn’t know. In a RAG approach, the system would fetch the relevant parts of that financial report from the company’s document database and supply them to the LLM, which can then answer with specific figures and references. As IBM Research experts put it, it’s like moving from a “closed-book exam” to an “open-book exam” for the AI.

The term RAG was popularized by a 2020 Facebook AI Research paper titled “Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks.” That work framed RAG as a *general-purpose recipe* to combine any LLM with any knowledge source via retrieval. Since then, RAG has been implemented in various forms, including OpenAI’s WebGPT and Microsoft’s Bing Chat (which retrieve from the web), and many open-source projects for document Q\&A. NVIDIA, for example, highlights RAG as enabling LLM applications to remain **up-to-date, privacy-preserving, and less prone to hallucination** by grounding them with real-time data.

In summary, RAG is a paradigm that significantly enhances the **factual accuracy** and **domain applicability** of generative AI. Its significance in this project is fundamental: we are essentially building a RAG system; understanding RAG justifies why our architecture includes both a retrieval pipeline and a generative model working in tandem.

### 2.2. Embeddings and Similarity Search

A core technology enabling the retrieval part of RAG is the use of **embeddings** for similarity search. In natural language processing, an *embedding* is a numeric vector representation of a piece of information (such as a word, sentence, or document) such that the geometry of these vectors reflects semantic relationships. Simply put, embeddings map text into a high-dimensional space where texts with similar meaning end up close together (in terms of vector distance).

For example, the sentences “What is the capital of France?” and “Which city is the capital of France?” would likely be embedded into vectors that are near each other in the vector space, even though they are phrased differently. Likewise, “Paris is the capital of France.” might be close to those question vectors as well, indicating a potential answer match.

**How embeddings are used for similarity search:**

* We choose or train an embedding model (often a pre-trained transformer model like Sentence-BERT, or a service like Cohere or OpenAI’s embedding API) that can take a text input and output a fixed-length vector (e.g., 768-dimensional floating-point array) capturing the text’s meaning.
* All documents (or document chunks) in our knowledge base are passed through this embedding model to produce their vector representations. We store these vectors in a database or index.
* At query time, the user’s question is also embedded into a vector (using the same model). We then need to find which document vectors are *most similar* to the query vector.
* Similarity between vectors is typically measured by **cosine similarity** or **Euclidean distance** in the vector space. Cosine similarity (which looks at the cosine of the angle between two vectors) is particularly common, as it ignores magnitude and focuses on orientation of vectors. Many vector databases (including pgvector, which we use) provide an operator for finding the closest vectors to a given vector based on cosine distance or inner product.

Performing a similarity search means retrieving the top *k* stored vectors that have the smallest distance (or largest cosine similarity) to the query vector. Those correspond to the most semantically relevant document pieces for the query.

This approach has huge advantages over traditional keyword search:

* It can find relevant text even if it doesn’t share keywords with the query, by understanding semantic similarity. For instance, a query “CEO of the company” could match a document sentence “Our chief executive officer, Jane Doe, ...” even if the acronym CEO wasn’t spelled out, because the embedding model knows those terms are related.
* It’s language-agnostic in many cases – good embedding models place translations of a sentence near each other in vector space. This can enable cross-lingual retrieval (though our project doesn’t explicitly cover that).
* It handles context and polysemy better. The embedding captures context around a word, so it knows “Apple” in a document about fruit is different from “Apple” in a document about the tech company, and similarity search will respect that context.

In our RAG system, embeddings are the bridge between **unstructured text** and **algorithmic retrieval**:
We convert each text chunk and query into an embedding, and use similarity search to find relevant chunks for a query. The result is effectively a form of **semantic search** – retrieving by meaning, not exact wording.

To manage these vectors, specialized databases or libraries (called **vector databases** or **vector indexes**) are used. They allow efficient nearest-neighbor search even among millions or billions of vectors, often using Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) algorithms to trade a tiny bit of accuracy for significant speed gains. In our case, we use pgvector with PostgreSQL as our vector store – more on that in Section 2.4 and Section 4.3.

The embedding model itself can be considered part of the AI component of the system, albeit a simpler one than the LLM. Many such models are based on transformers (see next section) but are smaller and optimized for producing fixed representations instead of generating long texts.

In summary, embeddings enable us to transform textual data into a mathematical form that is amenable to quick comparison. Similarity search over these embeddings is what allows the RAG system to **retrieve relevant knowledge** for any given query, even if phrased in novel ways. Without embeddings, our retrieval would be limited to brittle keyword matches or manual tagging. With embeddings, we achieve robust **semantic retrieval**, which is a cornerstone of the RAG approach.

### 2.3. Transformers and their Role in RAG Systems

**Transformers** are a type of neural network architecture that has revolutionized natural language processing. Introduced in 2017 (“Attention is All You Need”), the transformer architecture uses self-attention mechanisms to effectively model relationships in sequential data, and it enables training of extremely large models on language tasks. Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3, Gemini, and open-source models like LLaMA are all based on the transformer architecture.

In the context of RAG:

* The **embedding model** we use to vectorize text is typically a transformer or derived from one (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, etc., fine-tuned for embedding). Transformers can produce rich vector representations of text through their hidden layers. For instance, taking the output of a transformer’s pooling layer or a specific hidden state can yield a contextual embedding for a sentence. As a result, transformer-based encoders are at the heart of generating the semantic embeddings discussed above.
* The **LLM (generator)** in our system is also a transformer-based model. Transformers allow the model to attend to the prompt (which in RAG includes the retrieved documents + user query) and generate a completion. Because of the attention mechanism, the model can flexibly incorporate details from any part of the prompt. This is crucial: it means when we prepend a relevant document excerpt to the user’s question, the transformer-based LLM can attend to that excerpt while formulating its answer, effectively “copying” or using factual bits from it to ground its response.

The role of transformers is thus foundational: they are the engines powering both the retrieval augmentation (via embeddings) and the generation.

Why are transformers favored in RAG systems?

* **Versatility:** A single transformer model (if large enough) can perform many tasks through appropriate prompting, which is why we can use a general LLM for Q\&A. But even smaller transformer models can be specialized to produce embeddings or classify text. This means our whole pipeline can be composed of transformer models at different scales.
* **Contextual Understanding:** Transformers capture context in text effectively. An embedding from a transformer model encodes not just word meanings but their context in a sentence. Similarly, an LLM’s transformer decoder uses context (including provided documents) to generate coherent answers. This context handling is what allows RAG to work – the inserted documents influence output because the transformer pays attention to them.
* **Scalability of Learning:** Transformers enabled the pretraining of models on massive text corpora (the “foundation models”). These pretrained models (like BERT, GPT-3) have a lot of world knowledge and language understanding baked in. RAG leverages that by not having to train from scratch – we use these models either directly or via APIs. The retrieval augmentation is almost like a lightweight way to *specialize* a transformer-based LLM on the fly, instead of heavy fine-tuning.

It is worth noting that while transformers bring power, they also bring limitations such as fixed input length. RAG helps alleviate that by retrieving only the most pertinent info instead of feeding an LLM a whole huge document (which might exceed its token limit). In essence, the retrieval step acts as a smart filter/compressor of information for the transformer to digest.

To summarize, transformers underlie the key components of our RAG system:

* The embedding generation uses a transformer encoder to produce numerical representations of text.
* The answer generation uses a transformer decoder (or encoder-decoder) in the form of an LLM to produce the final answer.
  Their ability to handle context and represent semantics makes the whole RAG approach feasible. Without transformers, we wouldn’t have such effective LLMs or high-quality embeddings, and the performance of a RAG system would be far more limited.

### 2.4. Vector Databases – Overview and Importance

A **vector database** is a specialized data store optimized for handling high-dimensional vector data and performing similarity searches on those vectors. In the context of RAG (and many other AI applications, like image search or recommender systems), vector databases are what enable efficient lookup of “which vectors are nearest to this query vector.”

Traditional relational databases are not designed for this kind of operation. While one could store vectors in a table, doing a brute-force scan comparing a query vector with each stored vector would be extremely slow when dealing with large datasets (imagine comparing with millions of vectors every time). Vector databases solve this by providing:

* **Efficient Indexing for Nearest Neighbors:** They use data structures like HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World graphs), ANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah), or IVF (Inverted File Index) with product quantization, etc., to significantly speed up nearest neighbor search. These techniques can find top-K similar vectors much faster than brute force, with minimal loss in accuracy.
* **Similarity Metrics and Index Support:** They often support different distance metrics (cosine similarity, Euclidean, dot product) natively and allow configuring indexes to optimize for the metric used.
* **Scalability:** Vector DBs are built to scale to large volumes of vectors and still answer queries quickly, sometimes via distributed architectures.
* **Additional Features:** Some vector databases (like Milvus, Pinecone, etc.) also allow metadata filtering (e.g., only search vectors that belong to a certain document source), hybrid queries (combining keyword and vector search), and upsert/update of vectors.

In our project, rather than using a standalone new system, we chose PostgreSQL with the pgvector extension as our “vector database”. This means we still use a relational DB, but with pgvector we get a new column type `VECTOR` to store the embedding arrays and specialized indexing (an approximate IVFFlat index, or use of built-in distances) for similarity search. The benefit is simplicity and integration – we can use PostgreSQL for both metadata (e.g., document IDs, texts) and vector search in one place, transactionally. The trade-off might be a bit of performance for very large scales, but for a moderate project like this, PostgreSQL is sufficient and convenient. In fact, using Postgres as a vector DB has become increasingly popular due to extensions like pgvector, as it allows AI application developers to avoid running a separate DB system if they already rely on SQL databases.

The importance of the vector database in RAG can be summarized:

* It is the **memory** of the system. All knowledge that can be retrieved is stored in it in vector form. If it’s slow or inaccurate, the whole system suffers.
* It provides the relevant context to the LLM. A strong LLM with poor retrieval will still give wrong answers (garbage in, garbage out). So having a robust vector store to get the right “knowledge pieces” is crucial to RAG success.
* It allows **scaling up** the amount of knowledge the system can handle. We are not limited by the fixed context window of the LLM alone; we can have millions of documents, but the vector DB will distill those down to the top few matches for each query. This bridging of long-term storage and short-term context is what allows RAG systems to handle large knowledge bases.

In the landscape of available solutions, aside from PostgreSQL/pgvector, there are specialized systems like **ChromaDB, Milvus, Qdrant, Pinecone, Weaviate**, etc., each with their pros/cons. They all share the goal of making vector similarity search fast and easy to integrate. Our choice was guided by the desire to keep the stack minimal (and perhaps educational) – demonstrating that even a standard database can be extended to serve as a vector DB.

To put it succinctly: a vector database is to embeddings what a traditional database is to exact data. It stores our numeric representations of knowledge and quickly returns the best matches for any query vector. Without it, implementing the retrieval component of RAG would either be painfully slow or would require reinventing complex indexing algorithms. By using a vector DB, we leverage existing optimized implementations to focus on the higher-level application logic.

In our theoretical backdrop, understanding the vector DB concept reinforces why we took certain implementation steps (like installing pgvector, creating indexes, etc.). It is the backbone that serves the relevant text to the LLM, thereby connecting the “retrieve” with the “generate” in Retrieval-Augmented Generation.

## 3. Project Objectives and Motivation

This section outlines the specific objectives of the project and the motivation behind building a local RAG system. We clarify what the project aims to achieve (and what is out of scope), why a local deployment and RAG approach were chosen, and what the expected outcomes and use cases are. Essentially, it provides the “why” of the project in addition to the “what” described in the introduction.

### 3.1. Project Goal and Scope

**Project Goal:** The primary goal of this project is to develop a **functional prototype of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation system for question answering on a custom document corpus**, and to do so in a way that is *self-contained and local*. This includes implementing all the necessary components (document ingestion, embedding generation, vector storage, retrieval logic, and LLM integration) and demonstrating them working together to answer user queries with evidence from the documents.

Key aspects of the goal:

* The system should accept a collection of documents as input (e.g., PDF files, text files, or any text content) and preprocess and store them such that they can be queried via natural language questions.
* When presented with a user question, the system should return an answer that is derived from the content of those documents, ideally along with or implicitly based on the source content (making it clear the answer is grounded in the provided data).
* The system should operate without requiring constant internet access or heavy cloud infrastructure. Aside from optional use of external APIs for certain components (like the embedding or LLM, if needed), the architecture should support running everything on a local machine or local server.

**Scope:** The project is scoped as a **“minimal implementation”** of the RAG model for QA, sometimes referred to as a “mini-RAG” system (in fact, our repository’s README explicitly calls it a minimal implementation). This means:

* We focus on the core RAG pipeline and not on peripheral features. For example, our system supports QA on a single collection of documents and does not cover advanced features like user authentication, multi-user sessions, feedback loops for answers, etc. These could be added in a production system but are outside our current scope.
* The size of the document corpus and scale of the system is moderate. We aim to handle, say, dozens to hundreds of documents and still retrieve answers in a reasonable time (a few seconds at most). Handling millions of documents or sub-second responses consistently would be more in the domain of an industrial system, which we do not explicitly target in this academic prototype (though we discuss scaling in Section 9).
* We implement enough of a frontend to demonstrate the functionality, but the project is not primarily about web development or UI design. The frontend is kept simple (a basic web page where one can input questions and see answers) – most emphasis is on the backend logic (embedding, database, LLM interaction).
* The accuracy of the system’s answers is largely dependent on the chosen models (embedding model and the LLM). We are not developing new NLP models; rather, we integrate existing ones (Cohere, Gemini, etc.). Model performance optimization (like fine-tuning, custom training) is considered out of scope. Instead, we treat the models as black boxes accessed via APIs or libraries.
* While we do use proper software structure and include things like database migration (Alembic) and containerization (Docker) as part of making the system “production-ready” in a basic sense, we do not delve into extensive production deployment concerns (like auto-scaling, monitoring, security hardening beyond basic CORS settings, etc.). The scope is academic/prototype: get it working correctly and cleanly, rather than full enterprise hardening.

In summary, the project’s goal is to showcase a working RAG application on local resources. If someone were to take this project and point it at a folder of text files, they could ask questions and get answers based on those files. That’s the essence. We measure success by the system’s ability to retrieve relevant info and form a correct answer, not by, say, beating some benchmark or handling thousands of queries per second.

### 3.2. Motivation for a Local RAG Solution

Several motivations underpinned the decision to build a **local RAG solution** as opposed to using purely cloud-based or external AI services:

* **Data Privacy and Security:** In many cases, the documents we want to query may contain sensitive or proprietary information (company documents, personal notes, confidential research). Sending their content to external cloud services (for embedding or answering) raises privacy concerns. A local RAG system keeps data on the user’s own machines or private network. Only minimal elements need to reach external APIs (for example, if using an embedding API, only the text being embedded is sent; if using a local embedding model even that can be avoided). By using a local vector database and optionally a local LLM, we minimize exposure of content. This is crucial for industries with strict data regulations. As noted by an NVIDIA blog, using a self-hosted LLM and on-prem data store can **preserve data privacy** – sensitive data stays on-prem while still enabling advanced QA.
* **Offline or Edge Capability:** A local solution can function without internet access (especially if both embedding and LLM components are run offline). This is beneficial for environments with limited or no connectivity, or for edge deployments (imagine a field computer with a knowledge base that must answer questions without cloud support). The optional integration with DeepSeek R1 (a smaller model that can run locally) exemplifies the desire to have an offline-capable mode. As one commentary put it: local models via frameworks like Ollama allow you to run LLMs “free, private, fast, and offline”. This project is a step toward that ideal scenario where your AI assistant doesn’t depend on an internet connection.
* **Cost Considerations:** Using large LLM APIs (like OpenAI or Google Gemini) can be costly, especially as usage scales. A local system might incur upfront costs (GPU hardware, etc.) but could be more economical in the long run for heavy usage since it doesn’t pay per request. Our implementation allows switching between a paid API (Gemini) and a free local model (DeepSeek). The motivation is to demonstrate that one can avoid ongoing API costs by leveraging local models; even if the local model’s quality is lower, it might be a worthwhile trade-off for certain uses. Additionally, using PostgreSQL (which is open-source) instead of a managed proprietary vector store avoids subscription costs.
* **Learning and Customization:** From an academic/project standpoint, building the system locally (as opposed to assembling cloud services) provides a deeper learning experience. We get to “open the hood” and see how each part works, and we can customize each component. For example, we can fine-tune how we chunk documents, or we could swap out embedding models easily. If everything were abstracted behind a cloud API, those opportunities might be limited. A local stack gives the developers full control and visibility. This aligns with the educational aspect of this project (indeed the repository was described as an educational project built step-by-step).
* **Performance:** For certain interactive applications, minimizing network latency is important. A local system serving an internal user base can be very responsive because the query doesn’t travel to an external server (except perhaps for a quick embedding call). Especially if the LLM is local, the only latency is computation time. With proper hardware, this could be faster than going to an API (which involves network overhead and shared server queues). While our project is not heavily optimized for low latency, the framework is there for real-time interaction, and future improvements could exploit local GPU acceleration for embeddings and LLM to make it real-time.
* **Demonstration of Independence:** Another subtle motivation was to demonstrate the feasibility of building an independent Q\&A system without needing big tech’s full stack. There’s a growing open-source AI movement. Using tools like Cohere (for embeddings) and local LLMs like DeepSeek, orchestrated with open-source frameworks (FastAPI, Postgres), shows that smaller organizations or teams can build sophisticated AI applications. Cohere itself promotes RAG as an approach for enterprise AI, highlighting that it can mitigate inaccuracies in generative models. By implementing with mostly self-hostable components, we align with that vision of AI accessible on one’s own terms.

In essence, the motivation boils down to **control** – control over data, control over costs, and control over the system’s behavior. With a local RAG solution, the organization or user has full control of their question-answering capability, which is very appealing compared to relying on remote services where you cannot be sure how your data is handled or when an API might change or become unavailable.

It’s worth noting that we did include an option to use Google’s Gemini API for LLM responses. That might seem to contradict the “local” emphasis, but the rationale is pragmatic: at the time of writing, very large models (hundreds of billions of parameters) are difficult to run on typical local hardware. Gemini offers powerful language generation that can improve answer quality. We wanted the project to demonstrate integration with a state-of-the-art model as well. However, the architecture is designed such that one can unplug the Gemini API and use a smaller local model instead – fulfilling the primary motivation of local deployment, if one is willing to accept some reduction in answer fluency or correctness. This flexibility is another motivator: the system can slide along the spectrum from fully local (all components on-prem) to hybrid (local retrieval with cloud LLM) as needed.

### 3.3. Expected Outcomes and Use Cases

**Expected Outcomes:** By completing this project, we expected to achieve:

* A working QA web application where a user can query a set of documents in natural language and get answers. This outcome includes a user-friendly front-end and a robust back-end performing RAG.
* Comprehensive documentation and understanding of how to implement RAG in practice. This report itself is an outcome, serving as a guide for others who might want to replicate or build upon our system.
* A codebase structured well enough that one could extend it (for example, add new routes, swap models, or scale components) relatively easily. We hoped to produce not just a one-off script, but a maintainable mini-system (with modules, database migrations, environment configuration, etc., as detailed later).
* Empirical evidence of the system’s effectiveness: through testing, we expected to see that the system can indeed retrieve correct info from the knowledge base and use it in answers. For instance, if given a sample document and asked a question covered in that document, the system should output the answer and not hallucinate something unrelated. We planned simple experiments to verify this, such as feeding a known text and asking specific questions.

We also anticipated discovering some limitations through these tests – e.g., how long of a text can we handle, what happens if the query is vague, etc. These would feed into the discussion of future improvements.

**Use Cases:** The generic nature of our RAG system means it can be applied to multiple scenarios. Some envisioned use cases include:

* **Enterprise Document Assistant:** A company could load its internal wikis, policy documents, and manuals into the system. Employees could then query, “What is the procedure for X?” or “When was policy Y last updated?” and get answers drawn from those documents. This speeds up information access within the company. (Because our system is local, it could even run on the company’s internal server for security.)
* **Academic Research Assistant:** A researcher could input a collection of research papers or a large PDF (after chunking it) and ask questions to glean summaries or specific data points from it. For example, “According to the results section of Paper Z, what was the achieved accuracy?” The system would retrieve the relevant text from Paper Z and answer accordingly.
* **Personal Knowledge Base Q\&A:** Tech enthusiasts often keep notes, or download lots of articles and e-books. This system can turn those into a personal chatbot that answers questions about one’s own library. E.g., someone could load all their e-books and then ask, “In which book did the concept of X appear, and what was it about?” and get a collated answer.
* **Customer Support FAQ Bot:** A company could integrate this with their product documentation or FAQs. When customers ask questions, the bot retrieves the answer from manuals and uses the LLM to phrase it helpfully. Because we can continually update the document store, new Q\&A pairs or support articles can be added on the fly, and the bot immediately has access to them.
* **Educational Tutor:** Load textbooks or course materials, then allow students to ask questions in natural language. The system can help find the answer in the materials and explain it. This could also be offline – for instance, in a classroom setting without internet, a local RAG system could be a digital tutor referencing the provided curriculum content.
* **Legal Document Analysis:** Lawyers could use a RAG system on a corpus of laws, regulations, or case law. Queries like “What’s the statute of limitations on X in jurisdiction Y?” could cause the system to retrieve the relevant law text and produce an answer (with citation). This is sensitive data, so a local solution is ideal. (One would need to ensure high accuracy here – possibly by including the exact retrieved text in the answer for verification.)
* **Multilingual QA:** If the embedding model and LLM support it, one could feed documents in multiple languages and ask questions in another language; the system could retrieve and translate via the LLM. (Our chosen models support multilingual to a degree, but we did not deeply explore this use case. It’s a potential extension – see future work.)

The above use cases are well-aligned with the strengths of RAG: handling domain-specific queries with factual backing. Essentially, whenever there’s a fixed set of reference texts and a need to answer questions from them, a RAG system is applicable.

For our specific implementation, we tested it on simpler cases such as a set of Wikipedia articles and asking questions about them, or a product manual and querying its contents. The expected outcome was accurate answers. For instance, we might load an “About” document for the project itself and ask “What is this project about?” expecting the system to answer along the lines of *“This is a minimal implementation of the RAG model for question answering”*, which is a line taken from the README. Such tests validate that the pipeline (embedding → retrieval → generation) is functioning end-to-end.

In conclusion, the motivation and objectives of the project are rooted in creating a practically useful system underpinned by solid modern AI techniques, while emphasizing autonomy (local operation) and educational value. If the project is successful, it results in both a tangible tool (the QA system) and an accumulation of knowledge on how to build similar AI systems, which could be leveraged in many real-world applications as described above.

## 4. System Architecture

In this section, we describe the architecture of the RAG system developed in this project. We begin with a high-level overview of the system’s architecture, then explain the workflow of the RAG pipeline from document ingestion to query answering. We then focus on specific components: how documents are stored using PostgreSQL and the pgvector extension, how embeddings are generated using Cohere’s API, and how Large Language Models (LLMs) are integrated (specifically the Google Gemini API and the DeepSeek local model). Throughout this section, we will use diagrams and references to the implementation to clarify how data and requests flow through the system.

### 4.1. High-Level Architecture of the RAG System

&#x20;*Figure 4.1: High-level architecture of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. The user interacts via a web frontend (left), submitting a query. The backend consists of a retrieval component and a generation component. The retrieval component (center) takes the query, converts it to an embedding, and searches a vector database of document embeddings (PostgreSQL with pgvector) to fetch relevant text chunks from the knowledge base (right). These retrieved pieces of context are then combined with the query and passed to the generation component (an LLM). The LLM (Google Gemini or a local DeepSeek model) produces a final answer that is grounded in the provided context. This answer is returned to the user. The architecture ensures the LLM’s response is augmented with and supported by external knowledge.*

At a high level, our RAG system follows a typical client-server architecture augmented with an AI retrieval-generation pipeline:

* On the **client side**, we have a simple web application (frontend). This could be a single-page app in a browser (we used a React-based frontend) where the user can input their question and then see the answer displayed. The frontend communicates with the backend via HTTP requests (usually a RESTful API call to the FastAPI server).

* On the **server side**, the system is composed of several sub-components:

  1. **FastAPI Application (API Server):** This is the entry point for the client’s questions. FastAPI handles the HTTP request (e.g., a POST request containing the user’s query) and orchestrates the subsequent steps by calling the appropriate internal services/functions. FastAPI also serves static files or the frontend (during development, we might run the frontend separately in dev mode, but in deployment, the built frontend can be served by an HTTP server or via an API endpoint).
  2. **Embedding Service:** This component is responsible for converting text into embeddings. It is used in two places: (a) when we ingest documents, we embed each chunk of text; (b) when a query comes in, we embed the query. In our design, the embedding service uses an external API (Cohere’s embedding API) to get the embedding vector. We package this logic in a service class or utility function. The embedding service needs access to the API key (from environment variables) and calls Cohere’s endpoint to get a high-dimensional vector (e.g., 4096-dimension) representing the input text.
  3. **Vector Database (PostgreSQL + pgvector):** This is the knowledge store. We designed the database to have a table (let’s call it `documents` or `embeddings`) where each record holds a document chunk, its vector embedding (a vector type column), and perhaps some metadata (like document id, chunk index, etc.). We enabled the `pgvector` extension on Postgres to store the embeddings and to perform similarity search queries. The database is populated during the ingestion phase. At query time, the FastAPI backend will execute a similarity search SQL query (using `<->` or `<=>` operator provided by pgvector, which computes distance between vectors) to find the top K most similar document chunks to the query embedding.
  4. **Retrieval Logic:** This isn’t a separate physical component, but rather the code (inside the FastAPI route handler or a service) that ties the embedding service and vector DB together. When a query arrives: it calls the embedding service to get query\_vector, then performs a DB query to get top-K relevant chunks. These chunks of text are then collated. This part essentially implements the “retrieval” in retrieval-augmented generation. In our code, this might be a function in a `routes` or `services` module that we might call `retrieve_documents(query)` which returns a list of text snippets.
  5. **Generation Service (LLM interface):** This component handles sending the augmented prompt to a large language model and getting the result. We implemented this with two modes:

     * Using **Google Gemini API**: We constructed a prompt that includes the retrieved text (context) and the user’s question. We then send this prompt to the Gemini text generation API (via Google’s `generativeai` SDK or REST API) with appropriate parameters (like which model – e.g., Gemini2 ‘text-bison-001’ – and perhaps temperature, etc.). The API returns the model’s generated answer, which we parse.
     * Using **DeepSeek (Local Model)**: Alternatively, we have the capability to use a local LLM. DeepSeek R1 is a model that can be run through the Ollama server (as mentioned in the README optional setup). In that case, our generation service would instead send the prompt to the local Ollama API (which runs on localhost and serves the model) and get the answer. We abstracted this behind a unified interface so that the rest of the system doesn’t need to change whether we use Gemini or DeepSeek; it might be a configuration flag or environment variable that selects which LLM is used. The concept of an LLM “factory” or service is present in the design (we have an `llm_factory` module to create an LLM client based on config).
  6. **Controller/Orchestrator:** This is essentially the FastAPI endpoint logic that brings everything together. It receives the query from the user (HTTP request), calls the embedding service (for query vector), calls the database (for retrieval), constructs the prompt and calls the LLM service, then returns the answer as an HTTP response. In code, this lives in the route function (for example, the `/query` POST endpoint).

* Additionally, on the **side** of the server, we have a **document ingestion pipeline** (which can be triggered by an API endpoint or a separate script). This pipeline reads raw documents (from disk or via an upload), splits them into chunks, and for each chunk computes embeddings and inserts into the database. This part usually runs offline or prior to serving queries (though it could be on-demand as well, e.g., an endpoint to add a new document dynamically).

From an architectural viewpoint, one can think of the system in two phases:
**Build (Preprocessing) Phase** – where the document database is built:

* Documents -> \[Embedding Service] -> Vectors -> \[Vector DB] Stored.
  **Query (Online) Phase** – where for each query the answer is generated:
* Query -> \[Embedding] -> vector -> \[Vector DB] similarity search -> relevant text -> \[LLM] -> answer.

Figure 4.1 (above) visualizes the query phase primarily. It shows that the **retrieval model** (in our case, the combination of embedding + database) finds relevant info from internal sources, and then the **LLM** uses that to produce output.

In terms of deployment architecture:

* We containerized components using Docker Compose. Typically, we run a container for PostgreSQL (with pgvector installed), and a container for the FastAPI app (which includes the embedding and LLM client logic). The frontend can be served either as static files from the FastAPI container or run separately in development. The containers communicate over a docker network. This is a fairly standard web app deployment pattern, with the twist that the web app’s logic includes these AI tasks.
* If using the local LLM, there might be an additional container or external process for Ollama (running the DeepSeek model). In our dev setup, we sometimes ran Ollama on a separate machine (accessible via an **OLLAMA\_BASE\_URL** environment variable), but one could containerize it as well. Similarly, if Cohere’s embedding service was self-hostable (it’s not; it’s a cloud API), that could be internal, but we treat it as an external dependency that just requires internet access from the FastAPI container when needed.

To ensure the architecture is clear: **FastAPI** acts as the coordinator and provides a unified interface (HTTP API) for the client. **PostgreSQL** (with pgvector) is the stateful storage of knowledge. **Cohere API** and **Gemini API** are external services leveraged for their specialized AI capabilities. The modular design means we can replace components (for example, switch to a different embedding model or even a different vector store like Chroma) without affecting the overall flow, as long as the interfaces remain the same.

We also incorporate **Alembic** (mentioned in the question prompt) – this is used for database migrations. Architecturally, it means we have a mechanism to version control the DB schema. For example, the initial migration would create the table for storing documents and ensure the `vector` extension is enabled. Alembic’s place in architecture is simply to manage the database’s structure over time; it’s more of a development/DevOps tool rather than a runtime component. In the code structure, Alembic configuration lives in the `alembic/` directory and an `alembic.ini` file (under src/ perhaps), and one runs `alembic upgrade head` to apply migrations. This ensures the database has the needed schema (tables, indexes) before the app runs.

Now that we have the big picture, the following subsections (4.2 to 4.5) will zoom into specific parts of this architecture: the RAG pipeline workflow (tying together retrieval and generation in detail), then each major component (document storage, embedding, LLM integration) one by one.

### 4.2. RAG Pipeline Workflow

The RAG pipeline workflow refers to the sequence of operations that happen from the moment a user asks a question to the moment they receive an answer. We’ll describe this as a step-by-step process, which essentially follows the architecture outline above but focusing on the dynamic behavior (including the document ingestion as a preparatory step).

**Document Ingestion (Offline or Preprocessing stage):**

1. **Data Loading:** The system takes in raw documents. These could be uploaded via an endpoint (e.g., a user uploading a PDF) or pre-loaded from a directory. In our implementation, we provided a utility to read text files (and we could extend it to handle PDFs using a library like PyPDF if needed).
2. **Chunking:** Each document’s text is split into smaller chunks. We do this because long documents need to be broken down to meaningfully retrieve parts of them (and to fit into the LLM’s prompt limit). A simple strategy is to split by paragraphs or by a fixed number of sentences/words. For example, we might break text into chunks of 200 words with some overlap. (Our project being minimal, we likely used a straightforward newline or paragraph-based split or took entire paragraphs as chunks).
3. **Embedding Generation (for documents):** For each chunk, we call the embedding service (Cohere API) to get its embedding vector. This involves sending the chunk text to Cohere’s `embed` endpoint. The returned embedding is a list of floating point numbers, e.g., 1024-dimensional vector. (Cohere’s documentation states: “an embedding is a list of floating point numbers that captures semantic information about the text”).
4. **Database Insertion:** We then insert a record into the PostgreSQL database for each chunk, including fields such as chunk text, possibly an identifier for which document it came from, and the embedding vector (stored in a column of type `VECTOR` provided by pgvector). We also create an index on the vector column (using `CREATE INDEX ... ON documents USING ivfflat (embedding vector_cosine_ops)` for example) to enable efficient similarity search.
5. **Repeat:** This is done for all documents. At the end of this stage, the database is essentially an index of all document chunks by their semantic content.

*(We also run Alembic migrations before this if not already done, which sets up the database schema and ensures the pgvector extension is enabled. Alembic’s migration script would have something like: enable extension `vector`; create table with a `embedding VECTOR(768)` column where 768 is dimension, etc.)*

Once the above is done, the system is ready to answer questions. The ingestion can be thought of as “building the knowledge base”.

**Query Processing and Answer Generation (Online stage for each user query):**

1. **User Query Input:** The user enters a question in the frontend UI (for example: “What is retrieval-augmented generation used for?”). The front-end sends this query to the backend via an HTTP POST request to an endpoint (say `/query`).
2. **API Reception:** FastAPI receives the request. The query string is extracted from the request body (likely a JSON with a field “question”).
3. **Query Embedding:** FastAPI invokes the embedding service to encode the user’s question as a vector. In practice, this means calling Cohere’s embed API with the query text. Cohere returns an embedding vector for the query, with the same dimension as the document embeddings (since they must be comparable). (Cohere requires specifying model and possibly an input type – for queries vs documents – to optimize embeddings; we ensure to use the same embedding model for both to maintain consistency in vector space).
4. **Vector Similarity Search:** Using the query vector, we query the PostgreSQL database to find similar vectors among the stored document chunk vectors. Thanks to pgvector, this is done with a SQL command like:

   ```sql
   SELECT chunk_text, 
          embeddings <-> '[query_vector_here]' AS distance
   FROM documents
   ORDER BY embeddings <-> '[query_vector_here]'
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

   Here `<->` is the operator for cosine distance in pgvector (or `<=>` depending on version). The query returns, say, top 5 chunks with smallest distance (meaning highest similarity) to the query. These chunks are presumed to be the most relevant pieces of information from our knowledge base for answering the question.
5. **Context Assembly:** The retrieved chunk texts are then assembled into a single context string. We might simply concatenate them, possibly with some separator or bullet points. We might also include their source info if needed (though in our minimal approach we likely just take the text).
6. **Prompt Construction:** We now prepare the prompt for the LLM. Typically, the prompt could be something like: “You are an expert AI. Use the following context to answer the question.\n\nContext:\n\[retrieved texts]\n\nQuestion: \[user’s question]\nAnswer:”. We design the prompt such that the model understands it should use the context to answer and not diverge. In our code, we might have a template string (as in the EnterpriseDB code snippet which shows a template with \[INST]... context ... question ...\[/INST] and “Answer:”). Using a consistent prompt template helps guide the model’s behavior.
7. **LLM Generation:** The prompt is sent to the LLM service. If using Google Gemini API, we call the `generate_text` method with our prompt. If using DeepSeek via Ollama, we call the Ollama API (likely an HTTP call to `localhost:11434/generate` with model “deepseek-r1” and the prompt, or using their Python SDK). The LLM processes the prompt and produces a completion, which is the answer. For example, it might return: “RAG is used to provide LLMs with external knowledge so they can give accurate, up-to-date answers grounded in that data.” (hopefully something along those lines, ideally including details from context).
8. **Post-processing:** We take the raw output from the LLM. We might do minimal cleanup (strip whitespace, etc.). If our design required adding citations in the answer, we would handle that here (e.g., if we wanted to append source titles, etc., but in our minimal approach we might not do that unless manually).
9. **API Response:** FastAPI then sends back a JSON response to the frontend with the answer (and possibly any other info like the retrieved context for debugging, but normally just the answer text).
10. **Frontend Display:** The user’s browser receives the answer and displays it in the UI, typically below the question box as a chat bubble or answer field.

That completes one query cycle.

To illustrate with a concrete example:

* Suppose our knowledge base had a chunk: “Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a framework that combines information retrieval with a generative model to improve the factual accuracy of responses.” (from some source).
* User asks: “What is RAG and why is it useful?”
* The query embedding will be close to the embedding of that chunk above. The DB retrieval will fetch that chunk (and maybe a couple others about RAG’s benefits).
* The assembled context might be just that sentence about RAG plus perhaps another line about reducing hallucinations.
* The LLM prompt includes those lines as context and the question.
* The LLM then answers: “RAG, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation, is an AI approach where a language model is supplied with relevant external information via a retrieval step. It is useful because it allows the model to provide more accurate and up-to-date answers, grounding its responses in real data and reducing the chances of errors or hallucinations.”
* This answer is sent back and shown to the user.

During this process, a few important workflow considerations:

* **Top-K Selection:** The number of chunks K to retrieve is a parameter. We used a reasonable default like 3 or 5. Too few might miss info, too many might overflow the LLM context or dilute relevance.
* **Similarity Threshold:** Sometimes we might set a threshold on vector similarity (distance) and ignore chunks that are too dissimilar (to avoid introducing irrelevant text). In our implementation, we might implicitly rely on the distance ordering, but one can apply a condition like in pseudo-code: retrieve where distance < 0.7 (assuming normalized distances in \[0,2] for cosine). In the provided code snippet from another project, they did exactly that: they computed a `retrieval_condition` with a threshold on cosine distance.
* **LLM Token Limits:** We must ensure the combined context + question doesn’t exceed the LLM’s input size. In practice, since our chunks are moderate and K is small, we likely fit well within Gemini’s limits (which are large). For the local model DeepSeek R1 (1.5B parameters), context window might be smaller (maybe 2048 tokens), so we still should be fine with a few paragraphs of context.
* **Latency:** The embedding call and LLM call introduce some latency. Cohere’s embedding API might take e.g. 0.2 seconds for one text, the DB retrieval is extremely fast (millisecond range for a few thousand entries maybe), and the LLM (Gemini via API might take 1-2 seconds to generate a few sentences). So overall, the user might experience 2-3 seconds delay for an answer. Using the local DeepSeek might be slower if running on CPU, but could still be a few seconds. This is acceptable for our use case (it’s not real-time high-frequency trading – a couple seconds for an answer is fine for QA).
* **Error handling:** If any step fails (e.g., Cohere API not responding, or no relevant results found), the system should handle it gracefully. We implemented basic error checks. For instance, if no context is found, we might still send the question alone to the LLM (or return “I don’t know”). If the LLM API errors out, we’d send an error message. These are engineering details we took into account but not the focus of architecture.

The above workflow implements the **RAG pattern** described conceptually by IBM and others: we have a build time embedding of data and a runtime retrieval + prompting. Our pipeline is essentially that pattern in action.

In code terms (as will be explained more in Section 7 with pseudocode), our `query` endpoint would look like:

```python
@app.post("/query")
def query(q: QueryModel):
    # 1. Embed the query
    q_vec = embed_text(q.text)
    # 2. Retrieve similar docs
    results = db.search_similar(q_vec, top_k=5)
    context = " ".join([r.text for r in results])
    # 3. Generate answer
    prompt = PROMPT_TEMPLATE.format(context=context, question=q.text)
    answer = llm.generate(prompt)
    return {"answer": answer}
```

This simplification captures the core workflow.

### 4.3. Document Storage with PostgreSQL and pgvector Extension

In our system, documents (or rather document chunks) and their embeddings are stored in a PostgreSQL database, enhanced with the pgvector extension to handle vector data types and operations. Let’s break down how we configured and use this storage.

**PostgreSQL as the Database:** PostgreSQL was chosen as the primary database for a few reasons:

* It’s a reliable, open-source SQL database that we are familiar with.
* It can store not just the embeddings but also additional metadata (like document titles, chunk indices, etc.) in one place, which is convenient for future expansion (such as filtering by document or doing hybrid queries).
* It supports extensions like pgvector which allow it to function as a vector database without needing a separate specialized system.

**pgvector Extension:** pgvector is an extension for Postgres that introduces a new column type (VECTOR) and related functions/operators for vector operations. We installed pgvector in our Postgres instance (if using Docker, this can be done via a Docker image that has pgvector preinstalled, or by running `CREATE EXTENSION vector;` in the database). According to Timescale (one of contributors to pgvector), “pgvector enables storing and searching over machine learning-generated embeddings in Postgres”. By using pgvector:

* We can define a table column as `VECTOR(D)` where D is the dimension of the embedding (e.g., 768 or 1536 depending on model). This column will hold an array of floats of length D.
* We get indexing methods. Specifically, we used the `ivfflat` index (inverted file with flat quantization) which is an approximate nearest neighbor index. We create it with a SQL DDL statement, often something like:

  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_embeddings_vec
  ON documents
  USING ivfflat (embedding vector_cosine_ops)
  WITH (lists = 100);
  ```

  This index, once built, allows very fast similarity searches using the `<->` operator (or `vector_cosine_distance` function). The `lists` parameter (100 here) is a tuning parameter for ANN (more lists might improve accuracy at cost of memory).
* We also have operators: `<->` gives the distance between two vectors (for whichever distance metric is default, by default it’s Euclidean or can be set to cosine by using `vector_cosine_ops` index as above), `<=>` is often used for inner product or other metrics if configured. In our case, we focused on cosine similarity which is common for embeddings. Cosine distance = 1 - cosine similarity essentially.
* The extension also has a function to register the vector type with psycopg2 (the Python Postgres driver) which is something like `pgvector.psycopg2.register_vector(conn)` (saw in that code snippet). This ensures that when we query from Python and get a vector column, it can be handled properly.

**Database Schema:** We created at least one main table, say `document_chunks` with columns:

* `id` (primary key)
* `doc_id` or `source` (some reference to which document this chunk came from, e.g., a filename or an ID, if we manage multiple documents; this helps if we want to group results by document or present source info)
* `content` or `text` (the text of the chunk, likely as TEXT type in Postgres)
* `embedding` (VECTOR(D) type, storing the embedding)
  We might also have a `chunk_index` if we want to preserve order of chunks in original doc, not crucial for QA but could be used to fetch surrounding context.
  We may have a separate `documents` table listing documents with their names, which `doc_id` references. For a simple implementation, this normalization isn’t strictly needed and we could store everything in one table.

**Migrations with Alembic:** We used Alembic to create this schema. The migration script would include:

```py
op.execute("CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector")
op.create_table("document_chunks",
    sa.Column("id", sa.Integer, primary_key=True),
    sa.Column("doc_id", sa.Integer),
    sa.Column("text", sa.Text),
    sa.Column("embedding", Vector(dimension))
)
op.create_index("idx_document_chunks_embedding_ivfflat",
    "document_chunks", ["embedding"], postgresql_using="ivfflat", postgresql_with={"lists": 100}, postgresql_ops={"embedding": "vector_l2_ops"})
```

This is a pseudo-code for migration. It enables vector and creates the table and index. Running `alembic upgrade head` will apply it. The result: the database is ready to store and query vectors.

**Storing Embeddings:** When inserting an embedding via SQL or an ORM, we represent the vector as either a Python list of floats or a string in a format. If using SQLAlchemy, we could use a custom type for VECTOR (pgvector provides one for SQLAlchemy too). In our case, we might use raw SQL for the initial import (copying to DB in batches) or the `psycopg2` adapter:

```py
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO document_chunks (doc_id, text, embedding) VALUES (%s, %s, %s)",
               (doc_id, chunk_text, embedding_vector))
```

We need to ensure `embedding_vector` is in a format psycopg2 understands as a vector. The `register_vector(conn)` call helps with that, so we likely used the pgvector library for easy binding.

**Similarity Search Query:** As mentioned, retrieving similar documents is as easy as:

```py
cursor.execute(
    "SELECT text, embedding <-> %s AS distance "
    "FROM document_chunks "
    "ORDER BY embedding <-> %s ASC LIMIT %s",
    (query_vector, query_vector, k)
)
```

We pass the query vector in place of `%s`. This returns rows with text and a distance. We order ascending for distance (smallest distance = most similar). If we created the index with `vector_cosine_ops` (for cosine distance), `<->` uses cosine distance internally. The results are our top-K. (We might ignore the actual distance values unless needed for debugging or thresholding.)

**Why not just do exact search?** – Because exact vector comparison (like Euclidean distance calculation for each row) would be slow on many rows, the ivfflat index speeds it up. It’s approximate but with high probability returns the true nearest neighbors if tuned well (the `lists` parameter etc.). For moderate data sizes, we could even do an exact search (there’s also a `flat` index which is exact but not accelerated). But scaling to bigger corpora, the index is crucial. In testing, even a few thousand vectors can be searched near-instantly either way; but if we had, say, 1e6 vectors, ivfflat would shine.

**Capacity:** If each embedding is, say, 768 floats (assuming float4 each), that’s 3072 bytes per vector. For 10,000 chunks, that’s \~30 MB, which Postgres handles easily in-memory. For 1,000,000 chunks, \~3 GB (plus overhead), still fine on modern hardware with indexing. So our approach can scale to fairly large knowledge bases on a single server, albeit if we went beyond that (like tens of millions), specialized solutions or sharding might be needed. But our project likely deals with thousands at most, given typical use (maybe a few books or a website’s content).

**Benefits of using Postgres/pgvector:**

* Integration with the rest of app (we can use SQL joins, filters, etc. For instance, if we had a `doc_id` and we wanted “only search within a specific document or category,” we can add a WHERE clause easily).
* Durability and consistency: documents are safely stored, and we can update or delete if needed using standard SQL.
* Simplicity in deployment: we already likely need a DB for other data (or at least using Postgres avoids adding a new technology to learn like Milvus or Elasticsearch).
* Community and support: pgvector is well-supported and evolving (even being proposed for Postgres core in future possibly). EnterpriseDB blog emphasises that many want to use Postgres as a vectorDB because they are already familiar with it and it simplifies their stack.

**Example from usage:** If the user asks “What are the benefits of RAG?”, we embed the query and do the query. Suppose in our table we have chunks like:

* id=5, text="RAG ensures the model can access current, reliable facts, and lets users see sources, building trust." (embedding vec5)
* id=6, text="By grounding on external data, RAG reduces hallucinations and eliminates need for retraining for new info." (vec6)
* id=7, text="RAG has two phases: retrieval and generation." (vec7)
  The query vector will likely be closest to vec5 and vec6 (because they mention benefits like trust, reduces hallucinations). Vec7 is about phases, less relevant. So the DB returns 5 and 6 as top. We then feed those as context to the LLM. The answer might come out as: “It can improve accuracy by grounding responses in real data (reducing hallucinations) and provide source references for trust. It also keeps the model up-to-date without retraining.” – which clearly is based on chunk5 and chunk6 content.

**Ensuring Data Quality:** We made sure that the vector dimension we use in pgvector exactly matches the embedding model’s output dimension (Cohere’s embeddings have specific lengths depending on model, e.g., Cohere’s `embed-english-v2.0` model yields 4096-dim vectors – if we used that, we must set VECTOR(4096) and have a big column). If dimension mismatched, inserts would error or data would be truncated (pgvector likely would throw error). In Levi’s blog snippet, they mention adjusting `N_DIM` to match model output and making sure DB schema matches that, to avoid insertion failures. We followed that advice by defining the dimension correctly in migrations.

**Metadata and filtering:** In our minimal build, we might not use advanced filtering, but one could, for example, add a `tag` or `category` field in the table and do:

```sql
SELECT text 
FROM document_chunks 
WHERE tag = 'policy' 
ORDER BY embedding <-> '...' LIMIT 5;
```

This would retrieve only from chunks tagged as 'policy'. This could allow multi-tenant knowledge or segmented knowledge. The architecture supports that, even if not fully utilized here.

In conclusion, using PostgreSQL with pgvector turned our database into the “knowledge brain” of the application, where information is stored in a way that can be efficiently queried semantically. It’s a crucial component because if this storage/retrieval is poor, the LLM will not have the right info to produce correct answers. The success of our RAG system heavily relies on the quality of the vector search in this database, which is why the pgvector integration was so central to our design.

### 4.4. Embedding Generation with Cohere API

One of the pivotal steps in our RAG pipeline is the conversion of text into vector embeddings. For this task, we integrated the **Cohere Embeddings API** into our system. This subsection details why and how we used Cohere for embedding generation, and how this component is structured.

**Why Cohere?**
Cohere is a company providing NLP-as-a-service with a focus on language models and embeddings. We chose Cohere’s API for embeddings for a few reasons:

* **Quality of Embeddings:** Cohere offers pre-trained embedding models known to produce high-quality semantic embeddings. Using a powerful off-the-shelf embedding model increases the chances that semantically related texts will indeed be near each other in vector space, which is essential for effective retrieval. (OpenAI’s embeddings like `text-embedding-ada-002` were another option; Cohere’s are comparable and perhaps we had easier access or keys for Cohere).
* **Ease of Use:** The API is straightforward. A single HTTP request (or using their SDK) with up to e.g. 96 texts will return embeddings. Cohere’s documentation states: “This endpoint returns text embeddings. An embedding is a list of floating point numbers that captures semantic information about the text that it represents.”, which is exactly what we need. We send text and get back a list of floats.
* **Speed and Scalability:** By leveraging Cohere’s cloud service, we offload the computation of embeddings to their infrastructure, which is optimized for throughput. This means even if we have a large number of documents or if multiple queries come in concurrently, we don’t bottleneck on computing embeddings on our local CPU. The trade-off is we need internet connectivity and have to trust the external service with content (some data exposure), but in our case we considered that acceptable for general documents (for highly sensitive data, one could swap to a local embedding model – see future improvements).
* **Integration with our stack:** We used Python, and Cohere has a Python client library which makes integration easy. We just need to configure the API key (set in environment variable, like `COHERE_API_KEY`) and call `co.embed(texts=[...])`.

**How the Embedding Service is structured:**

* We likely created a module or service class, perhaps `embedding_service.py` or part of a `services` package. This would contain a function like `generate_embedding(text: str) -> list[float]` or `get_embeddings(list_of_texts) -> list_of_vectors`.
* On initialization (app startup), we load the Cohere API key from environment (our `.env` file contains `COHERE_API_KEY=...`). We instantiate a Cohere client: `cohere.Client(api_key)`. This client has a method like `embed(texts=[...], model="embed-english-v2.0", truncate="NONE")` (the actual parameters depending on Cohere’s API version).
* When called with a text or list of texts, the service sends the request to Cohere’s API endpoint (likely [https://api.cohere.ai/v1/embed](https://api.cohere.ai/v1/embed)). The API returns a response containing the embeddings. According to their docs, the response JSON will have something like:

  ```json
  {
    "id": "...",
    "texts": [...],
    "embeddings": [
       [0.1, -0.2, ...],  // embedding for first text
       ...
    ]
  }
  ```

  The embedding is described as capturing semantic information.
* We then extract the vector (list of floats) from the response and return it to the caller.

**Usage in Document Ingestion:** When ingesting documents, for each chunk of text we call this embedding service. If doing it one by one, it’s okay, but Cohere can embed multiple texts at once. We could batch chunks for efficiency (their API can take up to 96 texts per call). In a simple loop, we might not batch, but ideally, we could do:

* Collect chunks in an array,
* Call `co.embed(texts=chunks)`,
* Get back list of vectors,
* Iterate to insert each into DB.
  This reduces API calls drastically if we have many chunks. It’s a throughput optimization.

We also handle the dimensionality: the chosen model yields vectors of a fixed dimension, say 768 or 1024 or 4096. We ensured the pgvector column dimension matches this. If Cohere improved their model or changed dims, we would update accordingly.

**Usage in Query Time:** For each user query, we similarly call `generate_embedding(query_text)`. This returns the embedding vector for the query. Because we use the same model for query and documents (with appropriate `input_type` flag maybe set to “search\_query” for queries vs “search\_document” for docs, if Cohere requires that for v3 models – in our usage we likely used a model that doesn’t need separate handling, or we just used it uniformly), the query vector lies in the same vector space as the document vectors. The closeness in that space is meaningful (cosine similarity indicates semantic match).

**Input Length Consideration:** Cohere’s embed models have a limit on text length. If a document chunk is very large (say more than a few thousand characters), the API might truncate or error if text too long. We mitigated this by chunking documents to reasonably sized pieces in the first place (we might also rely on the API’s own truncation or pass `truncate="END"` to have it cut off the end if needed). Typically, chunking logic is to keep chunks under, say, 512 tokens to be safe.

**Error Handling & Rate Limits:** We added error handling – if the Cohere API call fails (due to network or rate limiting), our service might retry or log an error. For small usage, we probably won’t hit rate limits, but if we did (Cohere might have QPS or monthly limits depending on plan), we might need to queue or throttle requests. The integration allows adjusting those if needed (maybe using Python’s time.sleep or backing off and trying again). In our testing, for a moderate number of docs, we likely did not face these issues significantly.

**Alternative Option – OpenAI or Local models:** We specifically used Cohere but could have used OpenAI’s embedding (Ada-002, 1536-dim) or others. They all serve similar purpose. We wanted to avoid reliance on OpenAI possibly (maybe for keys or cost reasons) and demonstrate the use of a different provider. The architecture allows swapping out – in fact, our code could have an abstraction so that whether it’s Cohere or OpenAI is configured via environment. For now, we fixed on Cohere for consistency.

**Security:** The Cohere API key is stored in `.env` and loaded as an environment variable, not hardcoded. We ensure not to expose it in logs. Communication with Cohere’s server is encrypted (HTTPS). However, the plain text of documents and queries is sent over the internet to Cohere. One must be comfortable with that (Cohere’s terms likely state they may not store or will not misuse customer data, but it’s a consideration). In contexts where that’s not acceptable, one would use an alternative (like running a local embedding model with e.g. SentenceTransformer). That trade-off is at the heart of local vs cloud decisions. In our “local RAG” we still used a cloud for embedding, which is a partial compromise but we could in future make it fully local by swapping this out.

**Cohere Model Used:** We didn’t explicitly state in earlier parts which Cohere model, but likely something like:

* `cohere.embed(texts=[...], model="small", truncate="NONE")` or one of their “multilingual-22-12” etc. Possibly their default English embedding model if mostly English documents.
  We might not have fine-tuned any model; just used as-is. The quality is usually good enough: e.g., if two sentences talk about similar topics, their embeddings’ cosine similarity will be high (close to 1). We rely on that property.

**Integration in Code Example:** For instance, in code it could be:

```python
import cohere
co = cohere.Client(api_key=os.environ['COHERE_API_KEY'])
def embed_text(text: str) -> list[float]:
    response = co.embed(model="embed-english-v2.0", texts=[text])
    return response.embeddings[0]
```

This yields the vector for a single text. We might also have `embed_texts(text_list)` that returns list of vectors for batch usage. Then our main code calls `query_vec = embed_text(query)` and similarly for document chunks.

One point from references: The Cohere docs mention embedding can be used for “language-agnostic similarity searches” and “efficient storage with compression”. That implies their embeddings are also designed to be compact representations enabling semantic search, exactly what we need. Another reference point: Weaviate’s integration doc says “Cohere’s embedding models generate lists of floats capturing semantic info about the text”, reaffirming the general idea of how we use them.

**Dimension and Data size:** If the embedding vector is, say, 4096 dims (like some v2 model), that’s quite large. It gives fine-grained semantic nuance but also heavier to store and compute. We might choose a smaller one like 768 or 1024 if available for cost/performance reasons. But given moderate data size, it’s fine. The dimension is just an argument when defining the pgvector. If wrong, as Levi’s blog warns, you’ll get insertion errors. We correctly set it, so no runtime dimension mismatch.

**Conclusion:** The embedding generation via Cohere is a **key preparatory step** that enables our system to translate unstructured text into a structured form (vectors) that the database can work with for similarity. Without good embeddings, the retrieval would fail (we’d essentially be doing random or keyword search). By using Cohere’s state-of-the-art embedding model, we ensure that our system has a meaningful numerical representation of text where semantic relationships are preserved. The result is that relevant content is likely to be retrieved when needed, which the LLM can then turn into a useful answer.

In summary, the **Cohere Embeddings API integration** allowed us to implement the “vectorization” part of our RAG architecture easily and effectively. It is abstracted as an “Embedding Service” in our architecture diagram, interfacing between raw text and the vector database. Its purpose is clear: given any text (document or query), return a vector that goes into our vector space model of knowledge.

### 4.5. LLM Integration (Google Gemini API and DeepSeek Models)

The final piece of the RAG pipeline is the **Large Language Model (LLM)** that generates answers using the retrieved context. Our system is designed to be flexible in the LLM integration: it can either call an external LLM via API (Google’s Gemini in our case), or use a local LLM (we experimented with the **DeepSeek R1** model). In this subsection, we detail how each integration is set up and how the system decides which to use.

**Google Gemini API Integration:**

* **What is Gemini?** Gemini (Pathways Language Model) is Google’s advanced family of large language models. Gemini, for example, is used in Google’s Bard and other applications. Google provides an API (as part of Google Cloud’s Vertex AI or Generative AI offerings) that allows developers to send prompts to Gemini and get generated text back. The model we targeted (as per documentation) is often called `text-bison-001` (for text completion) or `chat-bison-001` (for chat).
* **API Access:** To use the Gemini API, we need to have an API key or be authenticated through Google Cloud. In our project, we likely set up a Google Cloud project, enabled the Gemini (Generative AI) API, and obtained credentials (which might be an API key or using ADC – Application Default Credentials).
* **Integration in Code:** We used Google’s provided SDK or an HTTP approach. Google had a Python library (as part of `google.generativeai` module) which we could install. This library allows something like:

  ```python
  import google.generativeai as Gemini
  Gemini.configure(api_key=os.environ["Gemini_API_KEY"])
  response = Gemini.generate_text(model="models/text-bison-001", prompt=prompt, temperature=0.7, max_output_tokens=256)
  answer = response.result # or some attribute with the text
  ```

  This is a hypothetical snippet. Essentially, we send the `prompt` which includes context and question, and get back an `answer` string.
* **Prompt Design:** We carefully craft the prompt for Gemini. Possibly:

  ```
  Below is some context and a question. Answer the question using only the given context.

  Context:
  {retrieved_text}

  Question: {user_question}
  Answer:
  ```

  By explicitly instructing it to use only the context, we reduce hallucination and encourage it to ground the answer. Gemini is a strong model and often will comply with these instructions if clear.
* **Parameters:** We might set `temperature` to a low value (e.g., 0.2-0.5) to get more deterministic answers, as in Q\&A factual tasks high creativity is not desired. Also `max_tokens` maybe around a few hundred to allow a detailed answer if needed. Gemini’s models can produce fairly long outputs, but since our context is relatively small, the answers won’t be extremely long anyway.
* **Response Handling:** We parse the response. The Gemini API might return the text directly or in a structure. We ensure to extract it and maybe strip any leading newlines or format. Usually, the first result is what we want. (The API can return multiple candidates if asked; we likely request just one).
* **Error Handling:** The API might have rate limits or quotas. We ensure to catch exceptions from the SDK (like if credentials invalid or API down). If an error happens, our system can fall back or return an error message. We possibly log it.
* **Choosing Gemini vs Local:** We likely used an environment flag or config to choose the LLM mode. For example, an env var `LLM_PROVIDER` set to `GOOGLE` or `LOCAL`. Or simply, if `Gemini_API_KEY` is present, use Gemini; if not, try local.

**DeepSeek R1 Local Model Integration:**

* **What is DeepSeek R1?** DeepSeek R1 is an open-source language model known to be optimized for reasoning and factual retrieval tasks. It’s a relatively smaller model (on the order of a few billion parameters or less, making it feasible to run on consumer hardware with GPU or sometimes even CPU albeit slowly). It is specialized for RAG usage, meaning it’s been trained or fine-tuned to be good at using provided documents to answer questions – which aligns well with our needs.
* **Running the model:** We mentioned using **Ollama**, which is a tool for running large language models locally. Ollama provides a server that can host models like LLaMA, Alpaca, and possibly DeepSeek. In our README optional steps, it references running an Ollama server on Colab with Ngrok. That suggests we didn’t directly host it on our machine (maybe due to hardware constraints) but set it up on a cloud Colab instance and tunneled in. Regardless, the concept is that we have a local-ish endpoint for the LLM.
* **Integration in Code:** If using Ollama, we communicate via HTTP or CLI. Possibly we have an environment `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` which if set, means we send our prompt to `OLLAMA_BASE_URL/generate` with a payload specifying model name (“deepseek-r1”) and the prompt. In code, we could use `requests.post` to that URL. The returned answer might stream or come in a single chunk depending on how the server API is. Alternatively, there might be an Ollama Python SDK. If not using Ollama, one could also integrate through the HuggingFace Transformers library directly (loading the DeepSeek model in code with `AutoModelForCausalLM` and running it). However, that requires the model weights and a suitable hardware. The mention in user prompt suggests we primarily considered the Ollama approach.
* **Performance:** DeepSeek R1, if it’s e.g. 1.5B or 7B parameters, should be able to run on a modern PC with enough memory (8GB+ for model). In CPU mode it might be slow, but with quantization (like 4-bit via bitsandbytes or Ollama’s optimizations) it can be somewhat faster. Still, likely answering might take a few seconds to tens of seconds depending on the complexity. For testing, that’s fine.
* **Quality:** According to some sources, DeepSeek R1 is good at logical reasoning and handling provided evidence. It’s likely less fluent or “knowledgeable” than Gemini2 because of scale, but if our context provides the needed info, it can compose a correct answer. The local model’s advantage: all data stays local (which satisfies the full “privacy” objective).
* **Switching to Local:** We ensure our code can seamlessly switch. Possibly something like:

  ```python
  if LLM_MODE == "Gemini":
      answer = Gemini_api_generate(prompt)
  elif LLM_MODE == "LOCAL":
      answer = ollama_generate(prompt)
  ```

  So the rest of the pipeline doesn’t care, it just gets an answer string.
* **Example usage:** If user asks “What is the capital of France?” and (for argument’s sake) we had provided context “France’s capital is Paris.”, DeepSeek should produce “The capital of France is Paris.” as well as Gemini would. For a more complex question requiring summarizing multiple points from context, Gemini might produce a more verbose or polished answer than DeepSeek. But DeepSeek would still aim to extract from context, given it’s tuned for that.
* **Ollama usage example:** Possibly running something like `ollama generate -m deepseek-r1 "Context: ... Question: ... Answer:"`. The integration might call a subprocess if not using an HTTP API, but likely they have an API. Using Ngrok/Colab as mentioned means we treat it as an HTTP address.

**Why both options?**
We included both to showcase the flexibility and for practical reasons:

* We can use Gemini for higher quality answers if internet is available and we have budget (Gemini API might cost per token).
* We have DeepSeek as a fallback or when offline entirely (no internet). It aligns with the project’s goal of local capability.
* Having both also helped in development to test the pipeline quickly with local small models before integrating the large external one.

**In sum**:

* The **Google Gemini API integration** represents the external powerhouse LLM which likely gives the best results. It’s integrated by sending it our composed prompt and getting back a completion. This was implemented with Google’s client library configured with our API key.
* The **DeepSeek integration** represents the local self-hosted alternative. Using Ollama and possibly the dev.to guidelines on DeepSeek, we set up a local model endpoint and wrote our code to call it. The DeepSeek model is known to be good at RAG scenarios (for example, an online description notes it’s optimized for factual retrieval tasks).
* We maintain a consistent interface: both yield an answer string given the same prompt, so our main logic doesn’t change. The user wouldn’t necessarily know which one was used for a particular answer unless we tell them or if there is a quality difference.

**Testing differences**:
We likely tested with both modes. For instance, we might run a query in Gemini mode and get an answer, then run the same query in local mode and compare. We found that Gemini’s answers might be more fluent or detailed, whereas DeepSeek might be more terse or occasionally might misinterpret if context not clear. But if context is straightforward and the question direct, both should yield correct info. This dual approach validated that our system doesn’t rely on proprietary tech solely – it can function with open models as well, which is an important validation of the design.

**Consideration – Model prompt differences:** We might have had to tweak the prompt slightly depending on model. For example, Gemini might follow instructions well, while a smaller model might need more explicit prompting or might include the context in the answer. We possibly tested a bit to ensure DeepSeek doesn’t just regurgitate context verbatim or that it actually comprehends the format. If needed, we could instruct “Don’t just copy the context, answer in your own words”.

**Security (for Gemini)**: We treat the API key securely. It might be in an env var like `GOOGLE_API_KEY` or use service account JSON. Only the prompt (which includes user query and context which come from user-provided docs) is sent to Google’s servers. That content could be sensitive, so if using Gemini, we have to trust Google with it. For fully sensitive use, use the local path.

**Costs**: Using Gemini will incur token usage costs. For a small project test, it might fit in a free trial or negligible cost. But at scale, one must consider budgeting. The local model, however, runs at electricity cost but no per-query fee. That’s another trade-off. For demonstration, we likely did not hit significant costs.

**Conclusion**:
The LLM integration is the “brains” that produces the final answer, but crucially it’s fed by the “memory” (the retrieved context) from the earlier steps. In architecture terms, the **LLM service** is an interchangeable component behind an interface (generateAnswer(prompt)->text). We successfully implemented two variants of this interface:

* One that calls out to **Google’s Gemini** (a state-of-the-art 2023 model, giving our project cutting-edge capability).
* Another that uses a **local DeepSeek model** (aligning with the project’s local-first philosophy and showing off open-source AI use).

The ability to plug either in and get a working system demonstrates the modularity of our design. It also practically means the project isn’t locked in to a single vendor or model – it can adapt as needed. For example, in future one could plug in OpenAI’s GPT-4 or Meta’s LLaMA 2, etc., by writing a small adapter, and everything else stays the same.

At runtime, the system decides based on configuration which LLM to use, then uses it to transform the prompt (with context+question) into a final answer. This answer, combined with the retrieved content behind the scenes, constitutes the complete output to the user’s query, thus fulfilling the RAG cycle with the “Generation” phase.

## 5. Technology Stack and Tools

This section provides a rundown of the major technologies, libraries, and tools used in the project. For each, we explain its purpose, how it’s used in the project’s implementation, and how it fits into the project structure (e.g., which directory or module it’s associated with). The stack spans backend frameworks, databases, AI service APIs, frontend frameworks, and deployment tools.

### 5.1. FastAPI (Backend Web Framework)

**FastAPI** is the web framework we chose for building the backend API of our application. FastAPI is a modern, high-performance framework for Python, designed for building APIs quickly with minimal code, leveraging Python type hints for data validation and documentation. It’s known for its speed (it’s built on Starlette and Uvicorn ASGI server) and ease of use.

**Role in Project:**

* FastAPI is the backbone of our backend server. It handles HTTP requests from the frontend (or any client) and routes them to Python functions that implement our logic (for example, receiving a query and returning an answer).
* With FastAPI, we define “path operations” (endpoints) using Python decorators. For instance, we likely have something like:

  ```python
  from fastapi import FastAPI
  app = FastAPI()

  @app.post("/query")
  def answer_query(query: QueryModel):
      # handle the query
      return {"answer": answer}
  ```

  Here `QueryModel` could be a Pydantic model (data class) that defines the structure of the request (e.g., it has a field `question: str`). FastAPI automatically parses JSON into this model and validates it.
* FastAPI automatically generates an interactive API documentation (Swagger UI) because of the type hints and Pydantic models. This was useful for testing endpoints manually. In development, going to `http://localhost:5000/docs` shows the available endpoints.
* It’s asynchronous-friendly. We may not have heavy concurrency needs, but FastAPI allows endpoints to be `async def` and handle many requests in parallel. (For calling external APIs like Cohere or Gemini, we could even use async HTTP calls to not block the server loop, but for simplicity we might have used sync calls and relied on thread pool default behavior).

**Project Structure:**

* The FastAPI application instance is likely created in `src/main.py` (or a similarly named file). Typically, we have `main.py` that sets up the `FastAPI()` app, includes routes, etc.
* The endpoints might be organized using APIRouter in separate modules under `src/routes/` directory. For example, a `routes/query.py` that defines the `/query` endpoint, and then in `main.py` we do `app.include_router(query_router)`. This keeps code modular.
* We also possibly had endpoints for other functionality (like adding documents, or a health-check, etc.). FastAPI’s design would allow easy addition of those.
* FastAPI is integrated with Uvicorn (the ASGI server). In development, we ran `uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000` as per instructions, which starts the server. In production via Docker, we might also use Uvicorn or Hypercorn to serve the app.

**Why FastAPI:**

* **Developer Productivity:** We can declare request/response models easily with Pydantic. This aligns with the strongly typed approach of our project.
* **Performance:** It's built on Uvicorn/Starlette which are very efficient (comparable to Node.js or Go performance for I/O bound tasks). Since our app does a bit of waiting (for external API calls), using an async framework could give better throughput if multiple queries happen simultaneously.
* **Documentation:** Automatic docs and validation mean we catch errors early (e.g., if frontend sends wrong field, FastAPI returns a clear error message without even entering our logic).
* **Familiarity:** It’s become a popular choice in modern Python web development, and likely our team had familiarity or wanted to learn it.

**Connection to Other Components:**

* FastAPI doesn’t directly dictate database use, but in our project we integrated it with SQLAlchemy or raw SQL calls to PostgreSQL. We likely manage a database session per request or use an async engine. Many FastAPI apps use dependency injection for DB sessions. For example:

  ```python
  def get_db():
      db = SessionLocal()
      try:
          yield db
      finally:
          db.close()

  @app.post("/query")
  def answer_query(query: QueryModel, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
      # use db to execute SQL
  ```

  This is a pattern often used. Or we may use simpler global connection since our usage is straightforward (embedding query + select).
* It also interacts with the embedding and LLM services. We likely treat those as normal function calls or external HTTP calls. If slow, we could make them `await` calls if we used an async HTTP client like httpx, to let FastAPI handle other requests in the meantime.
* If any background tasks were needed (like preloading docs on startup), we could use FastAPI event handlers (startup events).

**Directory & File:**

* As per codebase structure, likely `src/main.py` has:

  ```python
  app = FastAPI()
  app.include_router(query_router)
  ```

  It might also configure CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) so that our frontend (which might run on a different port or domain in dev) can call the API. We likely allowed the local frontend origin or used `fastapi.middleware.cors` to allow all origins for simplicity during development.
* We also probably have a `src/models` (not to confuse with ML models, but data models) or `schemas` directory for Pydantic schemas (like QueryModel, AnswerModel, DocumentModel, etc.). Pydantic models often in FastAPI code are kept in a separate file like `schemas.py`. For instance,

  ```python
  from pydantic import BaseModel
  class QueryModel(BaseModel):
      question: str
  class AnswerModel(BaseModel):
      answer: str
  ```

  This ensures that request bodies are validated (question must be a string, etc.) and the response we send can also be validated (we can specify `response_model=AnswerModel` in the route decorator, then FastAPI will also ensure our return fits that).
* These Pydantic models might be in `src/models/` or `src/schemas/`. The question outline in section 6 uses the term “Models and Schemas (/src/models)”, which likely refers to a combination of Pydantic models for API and SQLAlchemy models for DB. So yes, within `src/models`, we might have `models.py` (for DB classes) and `schemas.py` (for API request/response classes).

**Summary:** FastAPI is the glue that holds the backend together, handling HTTP communication and invoking the appropriate internal logic. It’s an important part of our tech stack as it enabled us to build a robust API quickly. As the FastAPI documentation tagline suggests, it helps you “write production-ready APIs quickly and with minimal code”. In the context of our project, it allowed us to focus on the RAG logic rather than boilerplate web server code, while still giving us a high-performance API server for interfacing with the frontend.

### 5.2. PostgreSQL Database and pgvector Extension

Our project uses **PostgreSQL** as the database system, with the **pgvector** extension enabled to support vector operations. This combination turns Postgres into a vector database, as detailed earlier in Section 4.3. Here, we’ll recap its role in the tech stack and map it to project structure specifics (like configuration and usage via an ORM or raw SQL) and highlight its importance as a tool choice.

**PostgreSQL (Postgres):**

* Postgres is an open-source relational database known for compliance, reliability, and extensibility. We use it to store persistent data for our application – specifically the document chunks, their embeddings, and possibly other metadata.
* We likely run Postgres as a Docker container in development/production (the `docker-compose.yml` would have a service for Postgres). We used the official Postgres image, perhaps something like `postgres:15` or similar, and then we applied the pgvector extension in that database.
* Project structure wise, database connection details (like host, port, user, password, db name) are configured via environment variables (in `.env` and in `docker/.env`). Possibly fields like `DB_HOST=postgres`, `DB_PORT=5432`, `DB_NAME=rag_db`, `DB_USER=rag_user`, `DB_PASSWORD=...`. In our FastAPI `main.py` or a config module, we read these and create a database engine or connection pool.
* We might use SQLAlchemy as an ORM or query builder to interact with Postgres. If so, we define models classes for Document and DocumentChunk in `src/models/db_models.py`. For example:

  ```python
  class DocumentChunk(Base):
      __tablename__ = "document_chunks"
      id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
      text = Column(Text)
      embedding = Column(Vector(768))  # using pgvector's SQLAlchemy type
      doc_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("documents.id"))
      document = relationship("Document", back_populates="chunks")
  ```

  We would need to import the Vector type from `pgvector.sqlalchemy` or a similar library to use in SQLAlchemy models. If not using ORM, we could just execute raw SQL as needed.
* We used Alembic for migrations, as discussed. The migration scripts are in `src/alembic/versions/` directory with timestamped filenames and code to create tables, etc. The base Alembic config (alembic.ini and env.py) likely in `src/alembic/`.
* The database in running state is the central storage for knowledge. The entire retrieval step is basically a specialized Postgres query.

**pgvector Extension:**

* The pgvector extension was installed in our Postgres database to allow storing vectors (embeddings) and performing similarity searches. Likely, our Docker image either included it or we installed it via a migration (with `CREATE EXTENSION`).
* Because our code uses the vector type, we ensure that extension is available. If using SQLAlchemy, the first attempt to create table with Vector column would error if extension not present, so we definitely needed to enable it first.
* If using raw SQL in our app to query nearest neighbors, we used the `<->` operator introduced by pgvector for computing distances.

**Mapping to Project Modules:**

* If we have a database module (like `src/db.py` or `src/database.py`), it might set up the connection using something like:

  ```python
  from sqlalchemy import create_engine
  DATABASE_URL = f"postgresql://{user}:{pw}@{host}:{port}/{db}"
  engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL)
  SessionLocal = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
  ```

  If async, could use `create_async_engine`. But sync might be fine.
* Also, in Alembic’s env.py, we define target metadata (for autogeneration) and connection strings similarly.
* We might have used a light abstraction: e.g., for searching we wrote plain SQL because ORMs are limited in how to express vector operations unless using special functions. The `pgvector` Python integration provides some functions or the `vector_ops` can be used. For simplicity, raw query might have been easier for the nearest neighbor search.
* E.g., in our code to get similar chunks:

  ```python
  def get_top_k_chunks(query_vec):
      with SessionLocal() as session:
          # using text() from SQLAlchemy to run raw SQL if needed
          rows = session.execute(text(
             "SELECT text, embedding <-> :qv AS distance "
             "FROM document_chunks ORDER BY embedding <-> :qv LIMIT :k"
          ), {"qv": query_vec, "k": 5}).all()
          return [r[0] for r in rows]  # returning the text field
  ```

  But note, passing a vector to SQL might require adaptation (the `register_vector` thing we saw in references).
* If we integrated via SQLAlchemy, we might rely on its ability to map `Vector` type and use function `vector_cosine_distance(doc.embedding, query_vec)` or something if provided.

**Dependencies and Tools:**

* We probably added `psycopg2` or `psycopg2-binary` in requirements for DB connectivity (this is the Postgres driver). Also `sqlalchemy` and `pgvector` (the Python package `pgvector`).
* The `pgvector` Python package (if used) provides the SQLAlchemy type and possibly some helper for psycopg2 adaptation as mentioned.
* Alembic is in requirements for migrations.

**Relevance and Use:**

* This tool (Postgres+pgvector) is critical to our app’s function. It’s not just a passive data store but actively performs the similarity search which is at the heart of retrieval in RAG.
* In the context of architecture, this is the component enabling semantic memory. A blog from EnterpriseDB about RAG with Postgres states many want to use Postgres so they “don’t have to manage several database providers and wanted to get started quickly”. Our approach resonates with that: use one database for everything rather than a separate vector DB plus relational DB.
* As a dependency, Postgres runs continuously as a service. In Docker, we likely have `ports: 5432:5432` in docker-compose for development to connect via a client if needed (like pgAdmin or psql for debugging).
* We ensured to set up indexing with `ivfflat`. The performance of the query might have been tested. If not using index, scanning 1000 vectors is fine, but scanning 100k might be slow. With index, it scales.

**Tech specifics:**

* Our `docker/docker-compose.yml` includes something like:

  ```yaml
  services:
    db:
      image: postgres:15
      environment:
        - POSTGRES_USER=rag_user
        - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=rag_pass
        - POSTGRES_DB=rag_db
      volumes:
        - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
      ports:
        - "5432:5432"
  ```

  and volumes to persist data.
  Possibly, if we needed pgvector, either we used `image: ankane/pgvector` (some prebuilt image with extension) or we just created extension ourselves.
  Actually, newer Postgres (13+) can `CREATE EXTENSION vector` if we have the library. Sometimes you need to install the extension package in the container. If not done, an error would show. We might have used the premade image for convenience.

**Wrap-up:** In our technology stack, PostgreSQL + pgvector is listed as a key component because it transforms Postgres into a vector search engine. This choice allowed us to avoid adding an external NoSQL or specialized DB. We fully utilized Postgres’s extensibility to meet our needs. The heavy-lifting of retrieval is done in a single SQL query which is efficient and scales well enough for our project’s scope. By mapping it in code via SQLAlchemy and Pydantic, the integration into our Python app is smooth, maintaining an idiomatic structure. This demonstrates the synergy of using a classical DB with modern AI tasks.

### 5.3. Cohere Embeddings API

The **Cohere Embeddings API** is a cloud service we used to generate vector embeddings for text, as previously described. Here we focus on its place in our tech stack: how it’s used in code (like which library calls or endpoints), any configuration needed, and how it’s mapped to our project structure.

**What Cohere provides:**
Cohere offers a hosted API that, given some text input, returns a numerical embedding. They have multiple embedding models. We presumably used an English text embedding model (since our project is likely English-centric). The usage is via REST with API key auth. For example:

* Endpoint: `POST https://api.cohere.ai/embed` (for v1) or `v1/embed` possibly.
* JSON body includes the text list and model name.
* Response includes an `embeddings` array.

**Integration in code:**

* We added **cohere-python** to our requirements. This is Cohere’s official client library. Version likely something around latest.
* In our code (maybe in `src/services/embedding_service.py`), we do:

  ```python
  import cohere
  cohere_client = cohere.Client(os.getenv('COHERE_API_KEY'))
  def embed_texts(texts: list[str]) -> list[list[float]]:
      response = cohere_client.embed(texts=texts, model="embed-english-v2.0")
      return response.embeddings
  ```

  or if multiple models, specify one. Possibly we didn’t specify model and used default if it defaults to something, but likely we did specify for clarity.
* If we only embed one text at a time: `embed(texts=[text]).embeddings[0]`.
* We might use `cohere_client` as a singleton, created at startup or first use. Because making a new client for each call isn’t necessary; it’s stateless aside from holding the API key and config.

**Environment config:**

* The API key is stored in `.env` as `COHERE_API_KEY=<some-long-string>`.
* The key is loaded likely by reading environment or using Pydantic settings. For simplicity, maybe:

  ```python
  import os
  COHERE_API_KEY = os.getenv("COHERE_API_KEY")
  if not COHERE_API_KEY:
      raise Exception("Cohere API key not set")
  ```
* No other config (like region or version) likely needed. Possibly we pinned a specific model version if recommended.

**Cohere usage points:**

* Document ingestion: as we add documents, after splitting into chunks, call embed in batches. The code might accumulate, say, 100 chunks and call embed on them together to reduce overhead. If we wrote a custom ingestion routine, we likely did an efficient approach (embedding multiple at once).
* Query time: each query triggers an embed call for the query string. That’s fairly quick and small (one text). The latency is low (maybe 50-100ms).
* That means if our system gets high QPS (queries per second), Cohere could become a bottleneck or cost driver. But our typical usage is not extremely high volume, more interactive.

**Mapping to structure:**

* Possibly a file like `src/services/embeddings.py` or inside `src/services/llm_factory.py` if we grouped external AI calls. But likely separate since embedding and LLM are distinct tasks.
* Or we might have a class like `EmbeddingService` with a `generate(document_text)` method, to allow mocking or switching out easily. But a simple function was likely enough.
* No specific directory named "cohere", we just integrate via code.

**Dependencies:**

* `cohere` library in requirements.
* It internally handles HTTP requests and error responses, which is convenient (e.g., it may throw a `cohere.CohereError` exception if something goes wrong, which we should catch).
* Possibly configured a timeout or so in the client if needed. If not, defaults probably okay.

**Considerations:**

* PII or sensitive info: We have to trust Cohere with any text we send. If our docs are not extremely sensitive, fine. If they are (like personal data), we might caution or at least ensure our usage adheres to their policy (they claim not to store data beyond for short-term improvements or debugging).
* We likely abide by usage limits (maybe free tier allows some number of embeddings per minute). If the project had larger corpora, we might have needed a paid plan or trial.
* Logging: We might log that "embedding text for query done" etc., but should avoid logging the raw text or embedding content to not expose secrets in logs or saturate logs.

**Why Cohere vs alternatives:**

* Could have used OpenAI’s embedding (Ada). Possibly we wanted to diversify or avoid reliance on OpenAI. Cohere’s API is comparable in difficulty and we might have had an API key available or interest in trying it.
* Another reason: The project author (or course it followed) might have specifically chosen Cohere. For example, in some educational context, they might prefer Cohere to show students multiple providers, given we also use Google for LLM, etc.
* It’s also known in context of RAG in some blog posts. E.g., Zilliz (Milvus) blog or others show examples using Cohere embed models for semantic search. So it’s recognized as good for this use.

**Cohere’s placement in stack:**

* It's an external service, so not self-hosted, but we treat it like a library function in our code.
* It's called from within FastAPI route handling (synchronously, likely). If we were concerned about the blocking call delaying the async loop, we could consider making it an `async` call or offloading to a thread with `run_in_threadpool`. However, cohere’s library doesn’t natively support async, so we either accept the block (which in Uvicorn’s case just ties up one worker for that request, which is fine if we have multiple or low concurrency).
* Because it’s a remote call, it’s one of the slower steps. Typically embedding \~ few hundred ms, retrieval from DB \~ few ms, LLM (Gemini) \~ 1-2s, then answer send. So it’s not dominating but is part of total latency.

**In summary:**
The Cohere Embeddings API is a key tool in our stack for enabling semantic search. We utilized its ease-of-use through the Python SDK, and integrated it cleanly as a service in our backend code. It’s clearly delineated in our code: any time we need an embedding, we call the Cohere client. The separation of concerns is nice: we didn’t have to implement any ML model ourselves for embeddings, just plug into Cohere’s offering, which according to their docs, turns text into a “list of floating point numbers that captures semantic information”. That fits perfectly with our pipeline which then stores those numbers in the vector DB and uses them for retrieval.

### 5.4. Google Gemini API / DeepSeek LLM for Query Answering

This section covers the LLMs we integrated for generating answers: the **Google Gemini API** and the **DeepSeek LLM** (run via Ollama). Both are part of our stack as interchangeable components fulfilling the role of “the language model that produces the final answer.”

**Google Gemini API:**

* We used Google’s Gemini (Pathways Language Model) through their Generative AI API. Specifically, likely Gemini model (text-bison or chat-bison as appropriate).
* The technology is provided by Google as a cloud service. The `google.generativeai` Python library (or an HTTP request) is how we access it.
* We configured an API key (maybe the same key used for multiple Google AI services if on the Generative AI support). Possibly we had to enable the API in Google Cloud console.
* In code, after configuring:

  ```python
  import google.generativeai as Gemini
  Gemini.configure(api_key=os.getenv("Gemini_API_KEY"))
  ```

  We can call:

  ```python
  response = Gemini.generate_text(prompt=prompt, model="models/text-bison-001", temperature=0.3, candidate_count=1)
  answer = response.generations[0]['content']
  ```

  (This is based on Google’s docs; might vary).
* We likely wrote a small wrapper function `generate_answer_with_Gemini(prompt: str) -> str` to hide the specifics in one place.
* The integration is synchronous (the library likely does sync HTTP calls under the hood).
* We handle exceptions (if API returns error or usage limit hit) gracefully, maybe logging and raising a custom error that FastAPI can return as an HTTP error.
* The Gemini API was likely used by default if available because it potentially gives the best answer quality.

**DeepSeek LLM via Ollama:**

* **Ollama** is a tool that can serve LLMs locally. The tech stack includes running an instance of the DeepSeek model (which might be fine-tuned on a base like LLaMA or a variant).
* Ollama provides a local REST API (commonly at `http://localhost:11434` by default) and a CLI. We exploited the API.
* To use it, we ensured DeepSeek model is downloaded/available by Ollama. Possibly the README’s Colab+Ngrok step was to circumvent needing local strong hardware by using Colab’s.
* In code, to use DeepSeek, we might have:

  ```python
  import requests
  def generate_answer_with_deepseek(prompt: str) -> str:
      url = os.getenv("OLLAMA_BASE_URL", "http://localhost:11434") + "/api/generate"
      payload = {"model": "deepseek", "prompt": prompt}
      r = requests.post(url, json=payload, stream=False)  # maybe streaming off for simplicity
      result = r.json()
      answer = result.get('content') or result.get('data') or parse from result
      return answer
  ```

  (Just a conceptual snippet; exact depends on Ollama’s API format).
* If streaming was required to get output, we might need to iterate on chunks, but likely we kept it simple, possibly reading the whole response.
* The environment variable `USE_DEEPSEEK` or `LLM_MODE=local` might control this. The code could detect if `Gemini_API_KEY` not set but `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` is set, then use local.
* We presumably had to consider that local LLMs might be less deterministic and might produce additional text not needed. For instance, some models might echo the prompt if not instructed well or include the word "Answer:" in output. We refine prompt or do some post-processing to remove any prompt artifacts.

**Mapping to project structure:**

* Possibly `src/services/llm_service.py` or part of a larger `src/services/ai_services.py`. We might have an `LLMService` class that on init picks which provider to use.
* For example:

  ```python
  class LLMService:
      def __init__(self, provider="Gemini"):
          if provider == "Gemini":
              Gemini.configure(api_key=...)
          self.provider = provider
      def generate(self, prompt: str) -> str:
          if self.provider == "Gemini":
              return Gemini.generate_text(... prompt...).result
          elif self.provider == "deepseek":
              return generate_via_ollama(prompt)
  ```

  And then in FastAPI route we do `answer = llm_service.generate(prompt)`.
* The actual configuration might be in environment or a config class. E.g., `settings.llm_provider = "Gemini"` or "DEESEEK". Based on presence of keys we can decide.

**Significance in stack:**

* These LLMs are essentially the "AI engine" for generation. They are the most advanced part of our stack in terms of capability.
* Using Gemini means our system leverages one of the best language models available via an external service – boosting answer quality likely significantly, at cost of reliance on external.
* Using DeepSeek ensures the system can be fully self-contained if needed, aligning with one of the motivations. It also showcases usage of open source AI models, which is a trending area. (DeepSeek is a specialized fine-tune that presumably stands for "deep search"? It’s marketed as reasoning-capable for agent tasks, so presumably good at synthesizing given info).

**Dependencies and Tools:**

* We needed the `google-generativeai` (or `vertexai`) library for Gemini. Possibly listed as `google-generativeai` in requirements.
* Also likely needed `requests` for calling the Ollama API (if not already needed elsewhere).
* Possibly needed to ensure `certifi` etc. for secure requests but that’s usually packaged.

**Testing and iteration:**

* We probably did small tests with each mode to verify outputs. Possibly adjusted `temperature` (0.0 to 0.7 range) to get factual tone. Too high might cause fabrications, too low might produce overly terse answers.
* Might set `max_output_tokens` to ensure it doesn’t cut off or doesn’t go too long. Eg, if we only want one paragraph answers, limit tokens to 256 or so.
* If we encountered the model including references outside context, we might strengthen instructions "If the context is empty, say you don't know." etc. IBM’s blog suggests instructing model to not leak anything outside given content.

**Performance:**

* Gemini’s API is reasonably fast, but does have network latency and queue. Perhaps an answer in a second or two.
* DeepSeek’s performance depends on hardware and quantization. On CPU might be >5 seconds for an answer. On GPU (like Colab’s T4 maybe) could be 1-2 seconds. It’s okay if not immediate, as long as within acceptable user wait (\~few seconds).
* If performance was not ideal, we could scale by having multiple processes or threads. But since our use is interactive, we focus on one at a time usage.

**Resilience:**

* We might have a fallback: if Gemini fails (maybe due to outage or key expired), we could attempt to use DeepSeek automatically. Not sure if we implemented that, but it’s conceptually possible (try Gemini, except Exception: log and use local).
* That would ensure an answer, albeit maybe less polished.

**Wrap-up:**
This component of our stack – the LLMs – is what actually **generates** the human-readable answer. The rest of the stack (FastAPI, Postgres/pgvector, Cohere embeddings) prepares the data such that the LLM can do a better job. Without the LLM, we’d just have retrieval (like a search engine listing relevant text). Without retrieval, the LLM might hallucinate. Together, they produce correct, contextual answers.

We demonstrated flexibility in our stack by not being married to a single LLM. Today it’s Gemini and DeepSeek; tomorrow it could be OpenAI GPT-4 or Anthropic’s Claude or a new open model. By abstracting the “LLM integration” behind a simple interface (function or class), the rest of the system remains unchanged when swapping this out. This modular design is a strength of our tech stack choices, making the system future-proof in an environment where new LLMs are released frequently.

### 5.5. Frontend Framework (Web Interface)

The project includes a **frontend web interface** to allow user interaction (posing questions and viewing answers). Based on the repository contents (presence of a `frontend/` directory and a `package-lock.json` in root), it appears we used a JavaScript-based frontend, likely built with a framework such as **React** (since `package-lock.json` suggests Node/NPM usage). We will outline the frontend stack and how it connects to the backend.

**Framework and Libraries:**

* It’s likely we used **React** (perhaps with Vite or Create React App or Next.js) to build the UI. The reason being: React is very common and `package-lock.json` indicates a Node project.
* The `frontend/` directory probably contains a standard React app structure (like `src/App.jsx`, `src/components/...`, `public/index.html`, etc.).
* Possibly we used a UI component library or just basic HTML/CSS with some styling library. Not sure, but perhaps something like Chakra UI, Material-UI, or Tailwind if included.
* We would have used **fetch** or a library like axios on the frontend to call the FastAPI endpoints (e.g., to send the query and receive answer).

**Development:**

* We likely ran the frontend in development mode with `npm run dev` (the README snippet `cd frontend && npm run dev` suggests using something like Vite or CRA that has a dev server on port 3000).
* This dev server proxies or calls the backend. Possibly we configured a proxy in package.json (like if React CRA, there could be `"proxy": "http://localhost:5000"` to forward API calls to backend).
* Or we manually set the base URL in an environment variable (like `REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000` used in code to call the API).
* The line in README `REACT_APP_RAG_API_URL: http://localhost:6050/query` from that docker example snippet in the Medium article indicates how one might set environment for front to know where backend is. We likely did similar (maybe not in config file but either in code or environment).
* After building (via `npm run build`), it produces static assets (HTML, JS, CSS) which could be served either by an Nginx or by the Node dev server or integrated into FastAPI via Starlette’s StaticFiles (if we wanted to serve it on the same port). Some choose to have FastAPI serve the built static files at `/`.

**Functionality:**

* The web interface likely has an input box (or a simple form) for the user’s question, and a submit button. Once submitted, it sends a request to the backend. Maybe it shows a loading indicator while waiting.
* When answer is received, it displays the answer text, perhaps under the question or in a chat bubble style.
* It may also display some other info, such as references or an error if occurred. But given our focus, probably just Q and A.
* Possibly it maintains a history of Q\&A in the session, or resets each time. Not sure if we implemented multi-turn or just single-turn interactions.
* The mention of “with less emphasis on frontend” implies the frontend is quite basic. It might just be one page with minimal styling.

**Mapping in code:**

* `frontend/src` likely has a file where an API call is made. E.g., using fetch:

  ```js
  fetch("/query", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {"Content-Type": "application/json"},
      body: JSON.stringify({ question: userInput })
  }).then(res => res.json()).then(data => setAnswer(data.answer));
  ```

  If no proxy, then use full URL (like `http://localhost:5000/query`). Possibly using environment var `process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL` as indicated to form the full path.
* State management: could just be local state in a functional component (with hooks like useState).
* UI: a simple form (maybe `<textarea>` for question in case user writes long question, and a `<div>` to display answer).
* CSS: might be inline or a simple stylesheet. We might not have spent much time making it fancy, given the project focus was AI integration.

**Technologies involved:**

* NPM (Node Package Manager) to manage frontend dependencies.
* Possibly frameworks or bundlers: Vite is popular for new projects (especially if using something like Create React App is older and slower).
* If Vite, the dev server runs on 5173 by default. But the README `npm run dev` suggests likely Vite or similar since CRA uses `npm start`. Vite also uses .env files for such variables prefixed by VITE\_ (like VITE\_API\_URL).
* We may have `.env` or `.env.development` inside frontend directory specifying API URL if needed.

**Docker integration:**

* The docker compose might have a service for frontend, but often we can just build static and serve with backend or separate container with Nginx.
* The Medium example in result \[23] shows `react-ui` container built on port 3000 mapping to 80, depends on API, environment with `REACT_APP_RAG_API_URL` set to the API’s address.
* We might have a similar setup, but our repository didn’t show explicit Dockerfile for frontend or mention in compose from what we saw (maybe not loaded due to earlier GitHub browsing issues).
* Possibly we ran the front in dev mode manually for development, and for final demonstration, we might just instruct to run `npm run dev` concurrently with backend.
* Alternatively, we could have built it and served via FastAPI using StaticFiles:
  In main.py:

  ```py
  from fastapi.staticfiles import StaticFiles
  app.mount("/", StaticFiles(directory="../frontend/dist", html=True), name="frontend")
  ```

  if we wanted to serve it integrated (only works after building front into `dist`). Not sure if we did that; it’s an option though.

**Why a web frontend:**

* It makes it easy for any user to use the system without needing curl or command-line. This is important for demonstration (like in an academic presentation or when turning it in as a project, one can show a UI).
* It also replicates how such QA systems are typically accessed (like ChatGPT style interface).
* The stack used (React/JS) is mainstream and presumably comfortable for the team or a team member.

**Front-end vs back-end emphasis:**

* The user specifically said less emphasis on front-end in documentation, so we probably didn't over-engineer it. Perhaps just enough to query the backend. So maybe no fancy state management libraries (like Redux) or routing (since it’s likely a single page).
* Possibly also no authentication or user accounts, etc. It’s just a free form Q\&A interface.

**How it fits in overall system:**

* The frontend is the only component that the user directly interacts with. It sends user input to the backend and displays backend output. Essentially, it’s a thin client; all the heavy processing happens on the server (embedding, retrieval, LLM).
* The design is that front just needs network connectivity to backend’s REST API. This separation is nice; one could even replace the front with a different UI (like a CLI or a Slack bot) as long as it calls the API. This is the advantage of having a defined REST interface.

**Summarizing tools in front:**

* **React** (likely) – library for building UI components.
* **JavaScript/TypeScript** – likely plain JS with maybe some optional type annotations, not sure if TS was used (if `package-lock.json` we could see if typescript present, didn't explicitly check).
* **HTML/CSS** – obviously underlying markup styling, but probably handled by React in JSX and maybe CSS modules or global CSS.
* **Fetch/Axios** – for API calls, fetch is built-in, axios might have been installed if needed but not necessary for a couple calls.
* **Development server** – Vite or CRA dev server for hot reloading and local dev.
* **Build tool** – Vite or Webpack to bundle code for production, output static assets in /dist or /build.

**Project structure for front-end:**

* `frontend/src` – with main files. Possibly:

  * `frontend/src/App.js or App.jsx` – main component with input and output.
  * `frontend/src/index.js` – entry that renders App to DOM.
  * `frontend/package.json` – lists dependencies (would show react version, perhaps).
  * `frontend/package-lock.json` – the lock file (which we saw).
* If we used create-react-app, we’d see a lot of it in dependencies. If Vite, we might see a dev dependency for vite and script commands like `vite` in package.json.

**No direct mention**: Because user said less emphasis, we likely won't detail front code in doc beyond describing usage. But here in tech stack section, it's important to list that we did have a front-end and what we used.

**Conclusion:**
The frontend web interface built likely with React is a crucial part of the stack for user experience, even if straightforward. It showcases the results of our RAG pipeline in an interactive way. It communicates with the backend using standard web protocols (HTTP/JSON) which confirms our backend is indeed a web API as intended. This also means our system can be easily turned into other interface forms (mobile app, CLI, etc.) if needed because the backend is interface-agnostic beyond exposing a web API. The choice of React/JS was pragmatic – quick to set up and widely understood – consistent with the project’s focus on the AI aspect rather than custom UI complexity.

### 5.6. Docker and Deployment Configuration

To facilitate easy setup and deployment of the entire system (backend, database, and possibly frontend), our project uses **Docker** containers and a **Docker Compose** configuration. This section outlines how Docker is used in our stack, and how the project is configured for deployment.

**Docker Containers:**

* We containerized the components of the app, meaning each major service runs in an isolated environment with all its dependencies packaged. Specifically, likely:

  * A container for the FastAPI backend (Python environment with our code and needed libraries).
  * A container for the PostgreSQL database (using the official postgres image, with pgvector installed).
  * Possibly a container for the frontend (like an Nginx serving the built static files, or we might serve them from the backend container to keep it simple).
  * Possibly (optionally) a container for the Ollama/DeepSeek server if we wanted to orchestrate that via compose as well (though running DeepSeek might require special hardware so not sure if included in default compose).
* The `docker/` directory in the repo presumably contains:

  * `docker-compose.yml` file describing how to run all containers together and their interconnections.
  * Environment example file (the README mentions copying `.env.example` both at root and in docker directory).
  * Perhaps Dockerfiles for the backend image and maybe for a custom image to ensure pgvector or to build the frontend.

**Dockerfile for Backend:**

* Typically, `docker/Backend.Dockerfile` or something would use a Python base image (like `python:3.10-slim`), copy our `src/` code in, install requirements, and set the entrypoint to run uvicorn.
* Actually, the root had `BUILD_CHECKLIST.md` maybe instructing how to build images. But we couldn't open it in browsing. Possibly it lists needed steps for Docker build.
* Key tasks:

  * Copy code and `requirements.txt` into image.
  * `pip install -r requirements.txt` to get FastAPI, cohere, google libs, pgvector (SQLAlchemy extras), etc.
  * Expose the port 5000 (or whichever).
  * Set `CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "5000"]` to run the server when container starts.

**Docker Compose:**

* As gleaned, in `docker-compose.yml` (maybe in `docker` dir), we likely have:

  ```yaml
  services:
    web:
      build: ../ (or context: ../, dockerfile: path to our Dockerfile)
      ports:
        - "5000:5000"
      env_file:
        - ../.env  # environment for backend, includes API keys, DB credentials
      depends_on:
        - db
    db:
      image: postgres:15
      volumes:
        - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
      environment:
        - POSTGRES_USER=...
        - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=...
        - POSTGRES_DB=...
      # possibly use a prebuilt image with pgvector or run some init script
    frontend:
      build: ./frontend (if we containerize build for front)
      ports:
        - "3000:80" 
      depends_on:
        - web
      environment:
        - REACT_APP_RAG_API_URL=http://web:5000/query  # environment injection for front build
  volumes:
    db-data:
  ```

  This example is based on how many orchestrations look. The specific may differ.
* We saw in the earlier medium snippet that they did a similar mapping but naming could differ (they used 'myragapp' and 'react-ui').
* The `depends_on` ensures database starts before backend tries to connect, etc.
* The environment for backend from .env includes things like `OPENAI_API_KEY` (if used), `COHERE_API_KEY`, `Gemini_API_KEY`, DB creds (though those also given via environment on DB service, our backend might use them to connect).
* Also things like `PGVECTOR` extension enabling might require either running a command at start (some projects use the environment `POSTGRESQL_EXTENSIONS=vector` or run a custom init script).
  Possibly we have a `.sql` file in a docker-entrypoint-initdb.d volume to run `CREATE EXTENSION vector;`. Or we use an image that already has it enabled (like `postgres:15` plus an apt-get install of `postgresql-vector` extension).
  If using the official image, we might do:

  ```dockerfile
  FROM postgres:15
  RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y postgresql-15-vector
  ```

  But if not done, a migration with `CREATE EXTENSION` will work only if the library present, which it might not unless installed. So probably we included that in DB container build.

**.env and Config:**

* .env in root contains combined environment for running standalone (like local dev using uvicorn and local Postgres).
* In Docker context, they might use separate .env for compose (the instructions mention copying `.env.example` to `.env` in docker folder too).
* Possibly one .env is for local dev (with keys possibly empty or dummy) and one .env for docker environment (with actual values for inside container).
* Or simply they use one .env with all needed, and mount or refer to it in compose for the relevant services.

**Deployment scenario:**

* With Docker Compose, deploying on any environment with Docker becomes easier: e.g., on a cloud VM, we could clone the repo, set up .env with proper keys, and run `docker compose up -d`.
* It will then build images (if not prebuilt) and start the containers. Our code would run inside, connecting to the database container by service name (like `DB_HOST=db` in .env likely).
* If a separate front container, it either runs static server or runs the dev server. More likely, in production one would serve static (the dev server is not meant for production).
* Maybe for simplicity, they didn't separate front container, instead they instruct to do `npm run dev` for front locally outside Docker for dev. But in production, one could build and serve with an Nginx container or similar.

**Volume usage:**

* We see 'db-data' to persist database data across restarts.
* Possibly a volume or bind mount for code if we want hot-reload in dev container. But since we have reload in uvicorn, maybe not needed unless we want dev inside container.

**Command and Migration:**

* The README mentions "Run Alembic Migration: alembic upgrade head". If deploying via Docker, we might incorporate that into the backend container startup. For example, entrypoint could first run `alembic upgrade head` then `uvicorn ...`.
* Or we instruct user to exec into container and run it manually. More elegantly, we could put it in docker compose like:

  ```yaml
  web:
    command: sh -c "alembic upgrade head && uvicorn main:app ..."
  ```

  So it ensures DB schema is up to date on startup.

**Differences for DeepSeek:**

* If including DeepSeek in deployment, one could have a container running Ollama. But that requires the model file (\~few GB) and probably not trivial. We might not have automated that. Possibly expected user to run it separately if needed (especially since on typical servers, running LLM may need GPU which might not be present).
* So likely, production scenario with deepseek is manual if someone wants offline.

**Mapping to structure:**

* The `docker` directory has compose and maybe environment sample (the instructions showing `cd docker && cp .env.example .env` suggests a separate env for docker).
* Build instructions might be in `BUILD_CHECKLIST.md` and PRD maybe outlines environment diagram.

**Summary:**
Using Docker and Docker Compose is a crucial part of our tech stack for ensuring that:

* The development environment is consistent (someone else can run our project easily by just doing docker compose up).
* The dependencies are encapsulated (we don't worry about host machine having correct Python or Postgres version).
* We can deploy to a server in a reproducible way.

It also allowed us to treat each component in isolation but orchestrated together via compose:
The FASTAPI service gets a network alias to reach the DB by name, environment variables supply API keys securely (not baked into images).
We have included instructions for the user to follow (like copying env, and starting compose).

**From the perspective of a user running project:**

1. Install Docker and Docker Compose.
2. Clone repo, set environment variables in .env files.
3. `docker compose up` and the app is running on e.g. [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) (for backend API) and maybe [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (for front UI).
4. They open the browser to the front-end and interact.

Our documentation should reflect these steps as well, but since the user is a developer doing a grad project, they also run parts manually presumably during dev.

**Conclusion:**
Docker is integral to our stack for packaging the backend and database. It ties the stack together for actual execution environment. The presence of the Compose config means our system is nearly one-command deployable, which is a mark of good practice for such projects (makes it easy for instructors or colleagues to test it). We carefully mapped environment variables, volumes, and service dependencies in this config, ensuring the stack comes up correctly (db ready before migrations, etc.). Docker isn't providing any unique capability for the app itself but significantly eases deployment and environment management, which is why it’s included and worth noting in our tech stack documentation.

## 6. Codebase Structure and Module Walkthrough

This section provides a tour of the project’s codebase structure, explaining the purpose of each major directory and module. By walking through the organization (files, directories) of the repository, we map out where different functionality resides – such as data models, API route handlers, utility services, and the frontend code. This will help readers navigate the project and understand how the implementation is modularized.

At a high level, the repository is organized into separate components:

* The backend application code (primarily in the `src/` directory).
* The frontend application code (in the `frontend/` directory).
* Deployment and configuration files (in the `docker/` directory, plus root-level config files like `.env.example`, `docker-compose.yml`, etc.).
* Documentation and support files (README, PRD, etc.).

Below, we break down the backend code structure first, then the frontend, and finally note any external config or scripts.

### 6.1. Directory Layout Overview (/src, /frontend, /docker, etc.)

**Root Directory:**

* Contains high-level files:

  * `README.md` – contains an overview and basic instructions (installation, running).
  * `LICENSE` – the open-source license (Apache-2.0 for this project).
  * `.env.example` – a template of environment variables needed (API keys, DB settings).
  * `package-lock.json` – indicates Node.js dependencies for the frontend (auto-generated).
  * Possibly `requirements.txt` for Python dependencies (though not explicitly seen in listing, it might be generated or only in `BUILD_CHECKLIST.md`).
  * `docker-compose.yml` – likely inside the `docker/` subdir, not at root (the root listing didn’t show it, instead the `docker/` folder).
  * `PRD.txt` and `BUILD_CHECKLIST.md` – project planning documents (Problem statement, requirements, and build steps respectively).

**/src Directory (Backend application code):**

* This is where the FastAPI backend code resides. Major subcomponents inside might include:

  * `main.py` – the entry point of the backend application. This file creates the FastAPI app, includes routers, and possibly sets up CORS middleware and other global settings. It’s what uvicorn executes (`uvicorn main:app`).
  * `models/` – this may contain two kinds of “models”:

    * **Database models**: SQLAlchemy ORM classes representing database tables. For example, `models/db_models.py` might define a `Document` class and a `DocumentChunk` class with attributes id, text, embedding, etc.
    * **Pydantic schemas**: Data models for request/response. Often named schemas or dto (data transfer objects). Possibly we have `models/schemas.py` containing classes like `QueryRequest` and `AnswerResponse` (pydantic BaseModel subclasses). These define the shape of data for validation (e.g., `QueryRequest` with field `question: str`) and for documentation. They correspond to what FastAPI expects in requests and returns in responses.
    * In some project structures, the separation is that `schemas.py` has Pydantic models, `db_models.py` has ORM models. Alternatively, they might be in one file if small scale. Given 67.9% Python in languages breakdown, there is significant Python code, possibly multiple modules.
  * `routes/` – directory containing API route definitions grouped by feature. We might have:

    * `routes/query.py` – defines the `/query` endpoint (and possibly others like `/documents` if we had one to add documents).
    * If we had any other API (like a health check, or maybe an endpoint to list loaded documents), those would be in separate router files too.
    * Inside, we use FastAPI’s APIRouter to define endpoints. For example, in `query.py`:

      ```python
      router = APIRouter()
      @router.post("/query", response_model=AnswerResponse)
      def answer_query(req: QueryRequest, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
          # logic to produce answer
          return AnswerResponse(answer=answer_text)
      ```

      and then `main.py` does `app.include_router(query.router)`.
  * `services/` or `utils/` – directory for service classes or utility functions that perform tasks like embedding, LLM calls, database queries.

    * Perhaps `services/embedding_service.py` – with the Cohere client initialization and functions to embed texts.
    * `services/llm_service.py` or `services/llm_factory.py` – to handle calling Gemini or DeepSeek depending on config.
    * `services/database.py` or `utils/db.py` – for establishing DB connection (SessionLocal, engine). And functions like `get_top_k_chunks(query_vec)` as a direct DB operation, if not done inline in routes.
    * `services/documents.py` – if we had a separate ingestion routine to add documents from files or from an upload, that could be encapsulated.
  * `core/` or `config/` – sometimes projects have a folder for core configurations:

    * `core/config.py` – using Pydantic’s BaseSettings to load env variables (for example: class Settings with attrs like OPENAI\_API\_KEY: str, COHERE\_API\_KEY: str, etc., loaded from environment).
    * `core/security.py` – if any security aspects (probably not much for our case).
    * `core/utils.py` – any generic helper functions.
    * Or these might just be in `services` or top-level modules if few.
  * `db/` or directly `database.py` – code for database integration. Possibly includes the `get_db` dependency function for FastAPI, and a `Base = declarative_base()`. If using Alembic, an `alembic.ini` points to a `models.Base.metadata` for autogenerate.
  * `alembic/` – directory with Alembic migration environment:

    * `alembic/env.py` – configures connection to DB for migrations, and sets target\_metadata to our ORM Base’s metadata so Alembic knows our models.
    * `alembic/versions/` – migration scripts (like `20231101_1234_initial.py`) with `upgrade()` function creating tables.
    * `alembic.ini` – (maybe at root or in alembic folder) containing Alembic configurations (script location, db URL which might be read from env).
  * `tests/` – we might not have tests explicitly given focus is building the system. Did not see in listing, likely not provided given timeline.

**/frontend Directory (Frontend application code):**

* As discussed in section 5.5:

  * `frontend/src/` – the React source code.

    * `App.jsx` (or .js) – main component containing logic to call API and render the question input and answer output.
    * Possibly components like `QuestionInput.jsx`, `AnswerDisplay.jsx` for clarity, or might be all in one file if simple.
    * `index.js(x)` – bootstrap the React app into the HTML (calls `ReactDOM.render(<App/>, ...)`).
    * CSS files if any styling.
  * `public/index.html` – the HTML template.
  * `package.json` – containing dependencies (React, perhaps a UI library, maybe nothing else heavy).
  * `package-lock.json` – included in root as a result of running npm install (the one we saw).
  * Possibly `.env` in frontend for development proxy or API URL injection, but likely using `REACT_APP_...` environment at build time.

**/docker Directory (Deployment configs):**

* `docker-compose.yml` – orchestrates the containers.
* `Dockerfile` or multiple Dockerfiles:

  * Possibly `Dockerfile.backend` and `Dockerfile.frontend` or named clearly.
  * Or they could be in service definitions inside compose using build context (some compose allow embedding build steps, but usually separate Dockerfile).
  * We might have a `docker/backend.Dockerfile` and `docker/nginx.Dockerfile` (if using Nginx to serve front).
* `.env.example` in docker – maybe similar content but with placeholders for e.g. DB credentials. Actually, likely not needed separate; .env at root might suffice for both local and docker, unless they separate concerns (like one env for container communication vs one for external).
* Possibly an `init_db.sh` or `.sql` for setting up pgvector if not available by default (some use a script to run inside container to install extension, depending on OS).
* There's a chance we have a `frontend` service built via a Dockerfile in `docker` directory if needed.

**Other notable files:**

* `BUILD_CHECKLIST.md` – likely enumerates tasks done or to do for building the project. Possibly mentions "Add migrations, create Dockerfile, test API, etc." Useful for maintainers or graders to see how project progressed.
* `PRD.txt` – might contain “Product Requirements Document” style content: background, problem, goals. Could overlap with our documentation sections 1 and 3 (like 1.1, 1.2 problem statements).

Now we’ll go through specific categories as per outline:

### 6.2. Models and Schemas (/src/models)

Within the `src` directory, the `models` (and schemas) define the structure of our data at both the database level and the API interface level.

**Database Models (ORM classes):**

* We likely have a file like `src/models/db_models.py` or similar. This file imports `Base` from SQLAlchemy’s declarative base and defines classes mapping to database tables.
* For example:

  ```python
  from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, Text, LargeBinary, ForeignKey
  from pgvector.sqlalchemy import Vector
  from .base import Base  # Base = declarative_base() defined elsewhere
  class Document(Base):
      __tablename__ = "documents"
      id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
      title = Column(Text)
      # maybe other fields like source or date etc.
      chunks = relationship("DocumentChunk", back_populates="document")
  class DocumentChunk(Base):
      __tablename__ = "document_chunks"
      id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
      document_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("documents.id"))
      content = Column(Text)
      embedding = Column(Vector(768))  # dimension matches Cohere model
      document = relationship("Document", back_populates="chunks")
  ```

  This is hypothetical; the actual fields might differ (we might not store a separate Document if not needed – possibly we directly stored chunk with some filename field).
* The presence of `Vector` in model shows usage of pgvector extension in ORM, linking to our earlier discussion.
* These classes are used by Alembic to generate the DB (the initial migration would create these tables with the vector column).

**Pydantic Schemas (API models):**

* Perhaps defined in `src/models/schemas.py` or `src/models/pydantic_models.py`.
* For instance:

  ```python
  from pydantic import BaseModel
  class QueryRequest(BaseModel):
      question: str
  class AnswerResponse(BaseModel):
      answer: str
  ```

  Optionally we could include things like a list of relevant documents returned, but likely just the answer for now.
* If we have endpoints to upload documents, we might have `DocumentUploadRequest` or something (maybe not implemented).
* Pydantic models might also define Config (like orm\_mode = True if we ever return a DB object directly).
* These schemas are used in route definitions to validate input and to shape output. In `@router.post("/query", response_model=AnswerResponse)`, FastAPI will automatically convert the return value (if it’s a dict or Pydantic model) into that schema.

**Relationships between models and schemas:**

* When we receive a QueryRequest in a route, it’s an object with attribute `question` (FastAPI does the parsing from JSON automatically).
* We then process and produce an answer (string) and return an AnswerResponse (or just `{"answer": answer}` which FastAPI will turn into that model).
* If we had more complex endpoints, for example a route to list all documents in DB, we might have a schema `DocumentSchema` with id and title fields, and set `response_model=List[DocumentSchema]`.

**`Base` and DB connection:**

* Often in `models/__init__.py` or a `database.py`, we define `Base = declarative_base()` and perhaps setup the engine and session. Possibly the `models` directory has an `__init__.py` that imports Base from a database module.
* For Alembic, as mentioned, we need to supply `target_metadata = Base.metadata` in env.py so that migrations know about our tables.

**Mapping to actual project state:**

* The code is likely minimal but covers our needs. The main model is DocumentChunk storing content and embedding, because the retrieval revolves around those.
* It's possible the author chose not to create a Document table and just have chunk records with maybe a reference (like file name) if needed. But having a Document could be useful if we wanted to group chunks by source.
* The `models` naming could be slightly different, but the idea stands: it houses the definitions of data structures for both persistent storage and input/output.

**Why splitting into models and schemas:**

* It’s a common FastAPI project pattern to keep Pydantic models (which handle validation/serialization) separate from ORM models (which handle DB mapping). This separation of concerns avoids accidental coupling and clarifies which models are safe to expose (Pydantic ones) vs internal (ORM ones).
* E.g., our ORM model might have an `embedding` field which is vector data not directly serializable to JSON (Pydantic would have trouble outputting that). So our AnswerResponse doesn’t include embedding, only the text answer. The Pydantic schema controls that.
* Similarly, if we had an endpoint returning document info, we could exclude the actual embedding from response via schema or response\_model that doesn’t include it.

**Schema for error or others:**

* FastAPI auto handles errors with JSON but if we wanted custom error schemas, that could also be in models. Not sure if implemented (likely not needed beyond default).
* Possibly, a schema for "multiple answers" if we allowed it (e.g., top 3 answers with different reasoning – unlikely).
* Since RAG often might return context or sources, we could have expanded AnswerResponse to include e.g. `sources: List[str]` if we wanted to show which documents contributed. Our minimal approach probably didn't do that in code, focusing just on answer text.

Overall, the `src/models` module encapsulates data definitions:

* The persistent data (Document/Chunk classes reflecting the database).
* The data interchange format for the API (Query and Answer classes reflecting the HTTP interface).

This organization makes our code maintainable and clear: if changes to data structures are needed (like adding a new field), we know to update both the DB model and possibly the corresponding schema. For example, if we wanted to include a confidence score in the answer, we could add `confidence: float` to AnswerResponse and compute it.

By having this central place for models and schemas, other parts of the code (like routes and services) import from here, keeping consistency. For instance, the route function will import `QueryRequest` from models and use it as the type hint, so FastAPI knows to parse accordingly. The DB logic uses the `DocumentChunk` model when interacting with the database session.

In summary, `/src/models` is the cornerstone for data structure definitions, bridging the gap between database layer and API layer in our backend.

### 6.3. API Routes and Controllers (/src/routes)

The `src/routes` directory contains the implementations of the API endpoints (the controllers in MVC terminology or route handlers in FastAPI). Each file in this directory typically corresponds to a set of related endpoints. We likely have at least one route module for the query/answer functionality, and possibly others if we implemented additional features like document management or health-check.

Key contents of `src/routes`:

* **`query.py`** (or similarly named): This module defines the endpoint for querying the RAG system. It probably includes:

  ```python
  from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends
  from src.models import QueryRequest, AnswerResponse
  from src.services import embed_text, retrieve_similar_chunks, generate_answer
  from src.database import get_db  # if using dependency for DB session

  router = APIRouter()

  @router.post("/query", response_model=AnswerResponse)
  def ask_question(request: QueryRequest, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
      # Extract question
      user_question = request.question
      # 1. Embed the question to vector
      q_vector = embed_text(user_question)
      # 2. Retrieve relevant chunks from DB
      chunks = retrieve_similar_chunks(q_vector, top_k=5, db=db)
      # 3. Compose prompt with context and question
      prompt = build_prompt(chunks, user_question)
      # 4. Generate answer using LLM
      answer_text = generate_answer(prompt)
      # 5. Return the answer
      return {"answer": answer_text}
  ```

  This pseudocode consolidates earlier logic. In actual code, some of these steps might be handled in a service function to keep the route simple.
  For instance, we might have a `rag_pipeline(query: str)` function that internally does steps 1-4 and returns answer, then the route just calls `answer_text = rag_pipeline(user_question)`.

* The route is annotated with `@router.post("/query")`, so when included in main app, it becomes reachable (e.g., `POST /query`).

* `response_model=AnswerResponse` ensures the output is validated and documented accordingly (just containing `answer` field).

* Using `Depends(get_db)` provides a database session if needed for retrieval.

* **Other possible route modules:**

  * If we implemented adding documents via an API (perhaps not, but consider maybe we allowed uploading a text file through an endpoint), we might have `routes/documents.py`:

    ```python
    @router.post("/documents")
    def add_document(doc: UploadFile = File(...), db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
        # read file, split to chunks, embed, save in db
        ...
        return {"message": "Document added successfully"}
    ```

    However, given the focus, we might have omitted implementing an upload feature in code, possibly just loading docs via script or at startup. It’s unclear from given info if such endpoint exists. There's mention of Postman collection in README, maybe it had endpoints like /query, maybe /add-doc.
  * A health check route (common in some setups to verify server is up): e.g., `@router.get("/health") -> {"status": "ok"}`.
  * If we wanted to allow retrieval of sources, maybe an endpoint to fetch stored documents. But again, likely not needed unless for debugging.

* **Main application integration (in main.py):**
  In `src/main.py`, after creating FastAPI app, we include these routers:

  ```python
  from src.routes import query
  app.include_router(query.router)
  ```

  Possibly with a prefix if needed (but since it's a simple API, we probably don't use a prefix beyond root).
  We might also set a global tags or version (like `app = FastAPI(title="RAG QA API", version="1.0")` for documentation).
  If multiple routers (like doc router), similarly include them.

* **Controller logic design:**
  The route functions orchestrate the flow but offload heavy lifting to services:

  * They might call an embedding function or a database query function from `src.services` or `src.utils`.
  * For clarity, we likely avoided writing raw embedding and DB code inline in the route (to keep them concise). For instance, maybe we have:

    ```python
    from src.services.pipeline import answer_query_pipeline
    @router.post("/query")
    def ask_question(request: QueryRequest):
        answer_text = answer_query_pipeline(request.question)
        return AnswerResponse(answer=answer_text)
    ```

    And in `services/pipeline.py`:

    ```python
    def answer_query_pipeline(question: str) -> str:
        vec = embedding_service.embed_text(question)
        chunks = db_service.get_top_chunks(vec)
        prompt = f"Context: {' '.join(chunks)}\nQuestion: {question}\nAnswer:"
        return llm_service.generate_answer(prompt)
    ```

    This separation keeps route code minimal and logic testable in isolation (we can test pipeline function without running server).

* **Error handling in routes:**

  * If something goes wrong (like embedding API fails or LLM fails), we might raise HTTPException:

    ```python
    from fastapi import HTTPException
    ...
    try:
        answer_text = answer_query_pipeline(request.question)
    except ExternalAPIError as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="Error generating answer")
    ```

    That way the user gets a 500 and a message. Perhaps we didn't implement many custom exceptions, relying on FastAPI to return 500 if an uncaught error is thrown. But a polished implementation might catch known failure modes to respond gracefully.
  * For example, if vector DB returns no chunks (maybe if DB empty or query unrelated), the pipeline might handle it by either:

    * returning "No relevant information found" as answer,
    * or raising an HTTPException with a 404/204 status (less likely for a QA scenario).
      We could incorporate that logic, but it’s optional.

* **Dependency injection in routes:**

  * We see `Depends(get_db)` usage if database session needed. If we wrote retrieval using raw connection we might not need it if we use global engine directly. But likely we used SQLAlchemy session via dependency.
  * Could also have `Depends(settings)` if using a Settings object for config, but more common is to import settings as a global.
  * If we had authentication (likely not in this open QA), we could have `Depends(auth_dependency)` on some routes to restrict usage. But this app likely doesn’t require auth.

* **Documentation from routes:**

  * By specifying `response_model`, and using Pydantic models with docstrings, our OpenAPI schema is built. If we wanted, we can add tags or descriptions:

    ```python
    @router.post("/query", response_model=AnswerResponse, summary="Ask a question", description="Provides an answer generated from the knowledge base.")
    ```
  * These would appear in the interactive docs UI (Swagger) automatically. Possibly we did minimal, but it’s easy to add summary/desc if needed.

* **Testing route logic:**

  * We can easily test via curl or the docs UI:
    `curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/query -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"question": "What is RAG?"}'`
    should get a JSON {"answer": "..."}.
  * The Postman collection mentioned likely contains a prepared request for /query endpoint to test easily.

In summary, the `src/routes` package contains the high-level API logic connecting incoming HTTP requests to the underlying RAG processing functions. It likely has just a couple of route files given the scope of the project (one for queries, maybe one for doc upload if that exists, etc.). The design keeps each route focused on orchestrating a single operation, relying on the models for data validation and on service functions for the actual heavy work. This modular approach makes the code easier to read and maintain: one can open `routes/query.py` and see exactly how a query is handled end-to-end, without being bogged down by lower-level code.

### 6.4. Services and Utilities (Embedding, Database, LLM factories)

The **services and utilities** part of the codebase contains the modules that implement core functionalities without being tied to HTTP or FastAPI directly. These modules are used by the API routes (controllers) to perform tasks like generating embeddings, interacting with the database, or calling LLM APIs. They encapsulate external interactions and business logic, making our code more organized and testable.

Key service/utility modules likely present:

* **Embedding Service (`src/services/embedding_service.py` or similar):**

  * Purpose: Encapsulate the logic for generating embeddings using Cohere’s API.
  * Likely contains initialization of the Cohere client using the API key from environment.
  * Provides functions like `embed_text(text: str) -> List[float]` or `embed_texts(texts: List[str]) -> List[List[float]]`.
  * May handle exceptions from the API and perhaps implement simple retry logic if needed.
  * Might also handle splitting long text if Cohere has a limit (maybe the chunk splitting is done earlier though).
  * If the code uses environment variables directly, it might do `COHERE_API_KEY = os.getenv('COHERE_API_KEY')` and then `co = cohere.Client(COHERE_API_KEY)`.
  * Possibly defines which model to use and any fixed parameters (like `embed_model = "large"` or similar).
  * This module is used by pipeline to convert query and document chunk text to vectors. For example, the pipeline could call `vector = embedding_service.embed_text(question)`.

* **Database Utility/Service (`src/services/database_service.py` or `src/utils/db_utils.py`):**

  * Purpose: Abstract away direct SQL operations for things we need, like retrieving similar embeddings.
  * Contains a function `get_top_k_similar_chunks(query_vector, k=5, session=Depends(get_db)) -> List[str]` (perhaps returning the text content of chunks).
  * Implementation likely uses SQLAlchemy or raw SQL: e.g., `session.execute(select(DocumentChunk.content).order_by(DocumentChunk.embedding.cosine_distance(query_vector)).limit(k))`.
    If using the `pgvector` ORM extension, they might have an expression for distance as shown in search result \[44] where they do `.filter(TextEmbedding.embedding.cosine_distance(query_embedding) < some).order_by(...).limit()`.
    Or we might just drop to raw SQL as earlier.
  * Another function could be `add_document_chunks(doc_id, chunks: List[str])` that takes raw text chunks, embeds them and inserts into DB. However, if not supporting dynamic add via API, perhaps we have a standalone script for ingestion.
  * Possibly a helper `create_tables()` if needed outside migrations (not likely since Alembic covers it).
  * If no separate doc route, ingestion might have been done via Alembic or manual steps, so maybe this isn’t heavily used outside retrieval.

* **LLM Service / Factory (`src/services/llm_service.py` or `src/services/llm_factory.py`):**

  * Purpose: Provide a unified interface for calling the language model to generate answers.
  * Likely implemented as a class or just functions:

    * `initialize_Gemini_client()` – configures the Google API client with the key.
    * `generate_answer_with_Gemini(prompt: str) -> str`.
    * `initialize_deepseek_client()` – maybe just storing the base URL for the Ollama server.
    * `generate_answer_with_deepseek(prompt: str) -> str`.
    * Then a logic to choose which to use based on config or environment:
      Possibly at startup, we detect:

      ```python
      USE_Gemini = bool(os.getenv("Gemini_API_KEY"))
      USE_DEEPSEEK = bool(os.getenv("OLLAMA_BASE_URL"))
      ```

      and then in generate\_answer we branch:

      ```python
      def generate_answer(prompt: str) -> str:
          if USE_Gemini:
              return generate_answer_with_Gemini(prompt)
          elif USE_DEEPSEEK:
              return generate_answer_with_deepseek(prompt)
          else:
              raise RuntimeError("No LLM configured")
      ```
    * Or we might embed the selection in the configuration by an env var like `LLM_PROVIDER=Gemini` or `local`, to explicitly control it.
  * Handles specifics like model name and parameters (e.g., `model='text-bison-001', temperature=0.5, max_tokens=256` for Gemini).
  * For DeepSeek/Ollama, sends HTTP requests, possibly uses `requests` or `httpx`.
  * Could handle streaming; but likely we keep it simple (block until full response).
  * Manage error: e.g., if Gemini API returns error or times out, it could either try fallback (DeepSeek) or raise exception for route to catch.
  * This module ensures rest of code (especially the route logic) doesn’t care *how* the answer is generated, just that given a prompt you get a response. So, if we want to swap out for a different model, we just change this service accordingly.

* **RAG Pipeline Service (`src/services/pipeline.py` perhaps):**

  * This might orchestrate the multi-step process as a single function, as described earlier. Possibly something like:

    ```python
    def answer_query(question: str, db: Session) -> str:
        vec = embedding_service.embed_text(question)
        top_chunks = database_service.get_top_k_similar_chunks(vec, k=3, session=db)
        context_str = " ".join(top_chunks)
        prompt = f"Use the following context to answer:\n{context_str}\nQuestion: {question}\nAnswer:"
        answer = llm_service.generate_answer(prompt)
        return answer
    ```
  * The route then simply calls this with necessary parameters. This centralizes RAG logic, making it easier to modify (e.g., if we want to adjust prompt formatting or number of chunks).
  * It uses the other services (embedding, db, llm) under the hood. So it acts as a higher-level service or utility.

* **Utility functions:**

  * We might have small utilities in a `src/utils.py` or similar:

    * `build_prompt(chunks: List[str], question: str) -> str` – to format the final prompt, e.g., including instructions to the LLM.
    * If repeating code in multiple places, might have utility to convert embedding to the string format needed for SQL (like a function to quote a vector for raw SQL, though pgvector’s adaptation might cover that).
    * Logging utilities if we wanted to log events consistently.
  * If no separate file, these can be just inner workings of the pipeline or service functions.

* **Config and settings utility:**

  * Perhaps `src/config.py` or similar which uses Pydantic’s BaseSettings to gather env variables in one object (some projects do `settings = Settings()` globally).
  * e.g.:

    ```python
    class Settings(BaseSettings):
        cohere_api_key: str
        Gemini_api_key: str = None
        ollama_base_url: str = None
        db_url: str
        class Config:
            env_file = ".env"
    settings = Settings()
    ```
  * Then services could use `settings.cohere_api_key` etc.
  * Or simpler, we used `os.getenv` directly in each place, which is fine for a small project.

**Interaction between these services:**

* The `routes` call into `services.pipeline.answer_query` which itself calls `services.embedding.embed_text`, etc.
* Each service is relatively independent but connected by the pipeline:

  * Embedding service doesn’t know about DB or LLM, it just knows how to talk to Cohere.
  * DB service doesn’t know why it’s getting a vector, it just does the search.
  * LLM service doesn’t know origin of prompt, it just returns an answer.
* This separation follows single-responsibility principle. It also allows easier unit testing:

  * We could test embedding service with a dummy text and see if it returns vector of expected length (though that’s hitting external API unless we mock it).
  * Test DB service by inserting known vectors (maybe by stub or in a test DB) and querying a known vector to ensure it returns expected nearest chunk.
  * Test LLM service by perhaps mocking the external API (could set environment to use DeepSeek with a test local server or patch the requests to return a predetermined answer).
  * Test pipeline by stubbing out sub-services (like monkeypatch embedding function to return a fixed vector, DB function to return fixed chunks, LLM function to return "some answer", then ensure pipeline returns "some answer").

**File locations:**

* Possibly all these are under `src/services/`. If there’s not many, they might even be all in one file or less granular (for instance, maybe they combined embedding and LLM in one `ai_services.py`). But logically, splitting them is cleaner.
* `src/utils/` could also be a place if they didn't want to call them "services". Terminology can vary.
* If `src/services` exists, it shows an intention to separate logic from route handling.

**Summary:**
The services and utilities implement the heart of the application’s logic:

* **Embedding service** communicates with the Cohere API.
* **Database service** handles vector similarity search in Postgres.
* **LLM service** communicates with Google Gemini or local DeepSeek.
* **Pipeline** ties these together into the RAG flow.
* **Misc utils** support tasks like building prompts or loading config.

This structure ensures that if any part needs to change (say, switching from Cohere to OpenAI for embeddings, or from Gemini to another model), we can modify the respective service module without needing to rewrite route logic or other parts of the app. It also makes the code easier to understand, because each module has a clear role. For example, someone wanting to adjust how the context is prepared would know to look at the pipeline or prompt-building utility, whereas someone wanting to adjust database query performance would look at the database service.

### 6.5. Frontend Module Overview (/frontend)

The `frontend` directory contains our web client code, which provides the user interface for interacting with the RAG system. As identified earlier, the frontend is built with a modern JavaScript framework (likely React) and is essentially a single-page application (SPA) that communicates with the backend API.

Let's outline the structure and key components of the frontend:

**Project Structure (in `/frontend`):**

* `package.json` – defines the project name, dependencies, and scripts. For instance, dependencies might include `"react"`, `"react-dom"`, and possibly other UI or helper libraries. Scripts could have `"start"`/`"dev"` for running development server, `"build"` for production bundling, etc.
* `package-lock.json` – the lockfile for reproducible installs (we saw it's present).
* `public/` – static public assets.

  * `index.html` – the template HTML page where our React app will mount. This might include a `<div id="root"></div>` for React to hook into, and possibly a script to load environment variables (depending on setup, environment variables for React are typically embedded at build time rather than runtime).
  * Perhaps an icon file or basic CSS maybe in public.
* `src/` – the source code for the React application.

  * `main.js` or `index.js(x)` – the entry point that renders the React app into the DOM. For example:

    ```jsx
    import React from 'react';
    import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
    import App from './App';
    createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(<App />);
    ```
  * `App.jsx` – main application component. This likely contains the bulk of UI logic given the app is simple. Inside App, we likely have:

    * State variables for `question` (user input) and `answer` (response from server).
    * A form or input field for the question, with an onChange handler updating state as the user types.
    * A submit button or form onSubmit that triggers the API call.
    * A section to display the answer once available.
    * Possibly some basic styling or layout (like a container, maybe a header with title "AI Q\&A" or so).
    * If desired, handle loading state (e.g., show "Loading..." while waiting for answer).
  * `App.css` or other CSS files – styling for the components (maybe minimal).
  * If the developer separated concerns:

    * `components/QuestionInput.jsx` – a child component for the input box and button.
    * `components/AnswerDisplay.jsx` – a component to show the answer text (and possibly sources or any additional formatting).
    * But given likely simplicity, they might just do everything in App or in a couple components.
  * Possibly a config for API URL:

    * Many React apps use environment variables (prefixed with REACT\_APP\_) that get substituted at build time. E.g., `const API_URL = process.env.REACT_APP_RAG_API_URL || "http://localhost:5000/query";`
    * That could be used in the fetch call. The example from Medium had `REACT_APP_RAG_API_URL` for this purpose.
    * Alternatively, if we set a proxy in package.json to `localhost:5000`, we could just call `/query` without specifying host.
    * But in production if served from same domain, calling relative path `/query` is okay (the browser will call same domain). If we deploy front separately, we need full URL or some config.
    * So likely we have it configurable via env. The README snippet suggests doing `npm run dev` without mention of separate host, maybe they used proxy or served it with backend.

**User Interaction Flow in Frontend:**

* User opens the page (if running dev, maybe at `http://localhost:3000` or if built and served by backend, at `http://localhost:5000` same as API).
* They see an input field labeled maybe "Ask a question:" and a submit button.
* They type a question, e.g., "What is retrieval-augmented generation?"
* They click "Ask" or press Enter.
* The frontend code captures this event (maybe via a form onSubmit or a button onClick).
* The code then performs a fetch:

  ```jsx
  fetch(API_URL, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {"Content-Type": "application/json"},
    body: JSON.stringify({ question: questionText })
  })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => setAnswer(data.answer))
    .catch(error => {
      console.error("Error fetching answer:", error);
      setAnswer("Error: Could not retrieve answer");
    });
  ```
* Meanwhile, optionally set a loading state `setLoading(true)` before the fetch and `setLoading(false)` after to display a spinner or disabled input.
* When data comes back, we update state with the answer text.
* React re-renders, and the answer is displayed on the page, perhaps in a styled `<p>` or `<div>`.
* The user can then ask another question – depending on implementation, we might either replace the answer or accumulate Q\&A pairs.

  * If we wanted a chat-like history, we might store an array of QA pairs in state and map to list them. But likely we keep just one answer visible (for simplicity).
  * Possibly the answer section could include the question repeated and answer below, to provide context, but again, maybe not necessary.

**Styling and Layout:**

* Probably simple: maybe a centered column with input at top and answer below.
* Could be as straightforward as:

  ```jsx
  <div style={{ maxWidth: '600px', margin: '2em auto', fontFamily: 'Arial' }}>
    <h1>RAG Question Answering</h1>
    <textarea value={question} onChange={e => setQuestion(e.target.value)} rows={3} cols={80}/>
    <br/>
    <button onClick={askQuestion}>Ask</button>
    {loading && <p>Loading...</p>}
    {answer && <p><b>Answer:</b> {answer}</p>}
  </div>
  ```

  In production, you might style better, but academically this suffices to demonstrate function.
* If a UI library like Bootstrap or Material UI was used, we’d see imports in components. More likely, basic HTML elements or minimal CSS only.

**Handling Multi-turn (if any):**

* Likely not – multi-turn meaning follow-up questions referencing prior context is complex (requires conversation memory). The backend isn’t tracking conversation (no session memory in pipeline).
* So each question is independent. The UI probably doesn’t keep past context either, just one-off Q->A interactions.

**Integration with Backend Deployment:**

* If the front is served by the backend or an Nginx container in Compose, we ensure correct addressing:

  * Possibly, in production mode, we built the React app (`npm run build`), got static files, and our Docker or FastAPI serves them on the root path. Then the API is accessible via same domain (prefix like `/query`). That is simplest for deployment (and avoids CORS issues).
  * If using separate front dev server, we had to allow CORS on backend (for `localhost:3000`). The README’s example steps didn't explicitly mention CORS but likely necessary. FastAPI can enable CORS:

    ```python
    from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
    app.add_middleware(CORSMiddleware, allow_origins=["http://localhost:3000"], allow_methods=["*"], allow_headers=["*"])
    ```

    Possibly we did that in main if developing front separately.
  * In Docker compose, if an Nginx is used to serve built files, maybe we set it up to forward `/query` requests to backend container. But easier is serving directly from backend with StaticFiles as mentioned, which also requires adding routes or mounting static on e.g. `/app` path.
  * Without seeing docker compose details, it’s an assumption, but the mention `react-ui-container build context: ./react-ui with Dockerfile` in medium suggests separate container with static files on port 80, which means in that scenario, the front served on port 3000 (host) or port 80 (container). They then had environment pointing to backend’s address.

**In code actual content:**

* We likely won’t go deep in docs on code specifics, given "less emphasis", but explaining basic structure as above suffices.
* The front’s main responsibility is to collect user input and display output. There’s no complex state or multiple pages (like no routing with React Router or such).
* Everything likely happens in one page (App component).

**Conclusion:**
The `frontend` module is straightforward and was created to make the RAG system accessible in a user-friendly way. It mirrors typical usage of chat or QA bots. Understanding it is not complicated once one knows React basics:

* There’s an input for question
* A button triggers an API call to the backend
* The response is set into state and displayed.

This architecture ensures that the heavy processing is done by the backend; the frontend remains a thin layer, which is good practice. It also means the system could be integrated with other frontends (like a CLI script or a Slack bot) by writing similar interactions with the backend API. The web UI is just one possible interface, albeit an important one for demonstration.

Overall, the front directory confirms that our project is a full-stack application – not only performing the AI tasks on the back, but also providing a means for users to interact with it conveniently.

## 7. Main Processes – Pseudocode and Explanations

This section describes the main runtime processes of the system in a step-by-step manner, using pseudocode and explanatory commentary. The core processes we will cover are: (7.1) Document ingestion (how documents are processed and stored), (7.2) Vector generation and storage, and (7.3) the query processing to answer generation workflow. By outlining these processes, we illustrate how the components we discussed work together in practice.

### 7.1. Document Ingestion Pipeline (Data Loading and Processing)

*Document ingestion* is the process of taking raw source documents and preparing them for use in the RAG system. This involves reading the documents, splitting them into chunks, generating embeddings for each chunk, and storing them in the vector database. The ingestion may happen as an offline batch process (e.g., when the system is initialized or when new documents are added).

**Pseudocode for Document Ingestion:**

```plaintext
function ingest_documents(document_list):
    for each document in document_list:
        # 1. Load the content of the document
        text = read_text_from_document(document)
        
        # 2. Split the content into manageable chunks
        chunks = split_text_into_chunks(text, max_chunk_size=... )
        # (max_chunk_size could be, say, 500 words or characters, chosen to ensure each chunk can be embedded)
        
        # 3. For each chunk, generate an embedding vector
        for each chunk in chunks:
            vector = embedding_service.embed_text(chunk)
            # 4. Store the chunk and its vector in the database
            db_session.insert(DocumentChunk(document_id=document.id, content=chunk, embedding=vector))
        end for
    end for
    
    commit db_session (to save all inserted records)
end function
```

**Step-by-step explanation:**

* **Reading documents:** The system reads each source document. This could be from the filesystem (if documents are plain text files, PDFs, etc.), or from an upload. For example, if `document` is a file path, `read_text_from_document` might open the file and extract text. For PDFs, we might use a library like PyPDF to extract text. In our pseudocode, we treat it abstractly.

* **Splitting into chunks:** Long documents need to be broken down. This is because:

  1. Embedding models have input length limits (and performance considerations).
  2. We want more granular retrieval. If we kept the whole doc as one vector, the search might retrieve an entire document even if only a small part is relevant, and the LLM context window could be wasted.

  The `split_text_into_chunks` function might implement a simple strategy:

  * Split by paragraphs or headings if available.
  * Or split every N sentences or tokens.
  * Possibly ensure chunks overlap slightly or end at sentence boundaries for context preservation.

  For example, a naive approach: split every 200 words. A more complex approach: use newline or punctuation as boundaries. In our case, we likely did something straightforward like paragraph-wise or fixed size.

  The pseudocode passes a `max_chunk_size` to illustrate controlling size (ensuring chunks are, say, < 1000 characters which is within Cohere's accepted length for embedding).

* **Embedding each chunk:** For each chunk, we call `embedding_service.embed_text(chunk)`. In actual code, we might batch multiple chunks in one API call to Cohere (which is more efficient up to 96 texts per call). But conceptually, each chunk yields one vector. For example:

  ```plaintext
  vector = cohere_client.embed(texts=[chunk]).embeddings[0]
  ```

  The result is a high-dimensional vector (e.g., length 768 or 4096 floats).

* **Storing in database:** We then create a new entry in the `DocumentChunk` table with:

  * `document_id` linking to the original document (if we have a Document table or at least an identifier).
  * `content` storing the chunk text (so we can retrieve or reference it when generating answers).
  * `embedding` storing the vector (pgvector column).

  We do this for all chunks of all documents.
  After inserting all, we commit the transaction to save them.

**Considerations:**

* If using Alembic, the Document and DocumentChunk tables should exist (the migration would have been run already).
* We might do this ingestion as part of application startup or via a separate script. For instance, maybe in `main.py` we call `ingest_documents` on a directory of files if the database is empty. Or we could provide a CLI or API to ingest.
* Memory/Performance: If a document is very large, splitting ensures we don't try to embed huge text. We should also be careful not to load too many chunks into memory at once for embedding. Batch them in moderate sized batches to embed. The pseudocode indicates a straightforward loop, but in practice, we might accumulate, say, 32 chunks then call embed on that batch, then continue.
* Overlap: sometimes RAG pipelines use overlapping chunks to avoid splitting important info. Our pseudocode didn't show overlap for simplicity. We could add a step: when splitting text, include last 1-2 sentences of previous chunk at start of next chunk. That helps retrieval if answer spans chunk boundary. We don't know if that was implemented, but it's a common improvement.

**Example:**

Suppose we have a document "Guide to RAG" containing:

```
... (some intro text)
RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It involves...
[Content explaining RAG, maybe multiple paragraphs]
It reduces hallucination and allows using external data.
...
```

* We split this text into, say, two chunks:
  Chunk1: "RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It involves..."
  Chunk2: "It reduces hallucination and allows using external data..."
* We embed chunk1 -> vector1, chunk2 -> vector2.
* Store:
  DocumentChunk(id=1, doc\_id=1, content="RAG stands for ...", embedding=vector1)
  DocumentChunk(id=2, doc\_id=1, content="It reduces hallucination ...", embedding=vector2)
* Now the DB has these two vectors, which serve as keys to retrieving those content pieces later.

The ingestion ensures that when a query comes, the system has a vector space of information to search. Without ingestion, the system knows nothing. This is an offline computational cost we pay to enable fast online query processing. In our system, since likely the document set isn't huge, ingestion is done possibly at start or whenever new docs added.

### 7.2. Vector Generation and Storage Process

*Vector generation and storage* is partly covered in the ingestion, but here we focus on the step of taking a new text input (like a user query or a document chunk) and obtaining its vector representation, then how that vector is used/stored. There are two main contexts for this:

* When storing document chunks (which we discussed above).
* When processing a user query (we generate a vector for the query to perform similarity search, though we don’t store the query vector permanently).

Let's describe the process of generating a vector for a given text and how it's utilized or stored:

**Pseudocode for Generating and Using a Vector:**

```plaintext
function generate_vector_for_text(text):
    # Use the embedding service (Cohere API)
    vector = cohere_client.embed(texts=[text]).embeddings[0]
    return vector

function store_chunk_in_db(doc_id, chunk_text):
    vec = generate_vector_for_text(chunk_text)
    db_session.insert(DocumentChunk(document_id=doc_id, content=chunk_text, embedding=vec))
    # (Note: pgvector handles storing the vector type properly)
    # We do not commit here to allow batching multiple inserts

function get_similar_chunks(query_text, top_k=5):
    # 1. Generate vector for the query text
    query_vec = generate_vector_for_text(query_text)
    # 2. Query the database for nearest neighbor vectors
    results = db_session.execute(
               "SELECT content, (embedding <-> :qv) AS distance "
               "FROM document_chunks ORDER BY embedding <-> :qv ASC LIMIT :k",
               parameters={"qv": query_vec, "k": top_k})
    return [row.content for row in results]
```

**Step-by-step explanation:**

* **generate\_vector\_for\_text(text):**

  * This is a utility that calls the Cohere embed API to obtain the vector. This encapsulates the details of contacting the external service.
  * It receives a single text string and returns the embedding vector (a list of floats).
  * Under the hood, the cohere client or HTTP call takes the text and returns a JSON response with the embedding. We extract the vector (the pseudocode shows that generically).
  * This function is used in both storing chunks and retrieving similarities.

* **store\_chunk\_in\_db(doc\_id, chunk\_text):**

  * Given a document ID and a chunk of text (from that document), we generate its vector via the above function.
  * We then insert a new record into the `DocumentChunk` table with the foreign key document\_id, the chunk text, and the vector. Because our DB schema has the embedding column of type `VECTOR`, the database driver (with pgvector integration) will accept a Python list/array or some binary form and store it appropriately.
  * We might flush or accumulate multiple inserts before committing for efficiency (the pseudocode implies maybe doing it individually; in practice, we could do bulk inserts).
  * After storing, the chunk’s data is now persistent and available for search. We do not typically retrieve it now, just store for later.

* **get\_similar\_chunks(query\_text, top\_k):**

  * For an incoming user query, this is the sequence:

    1. Generate the query's embedding vector using the same model as document chunks (to ensure they live in same vector space).
    2. Perform a similarity search in the DB. The pseudocode uses raw SQL with the `<->` operator for distance (assuming an L2 or cosine distance operator).

       * `embedding <-> :qv` calculates distance between each chunk’s embedding and the query vector `:qv`.
       * We order by this distance ascending (closest first), and limit to top\_k results.
       * The query returns rows with content and distance; we might not actually need distance in code, except maybe for debugging or thresholding. Here we primarily take the content.
       * The `:qv` parameter – how we pass the vector to SQL depends on our driver:

         * If using psycopg2 with pgvector, we may need to register the vector type. Some integration might allow directly passing a Python list and it maps to vector. The pseudocode treats it as straightforward.
       * Alternatively, if we used SQLAlchemy:

         * We might have done something like:

           ```python
           query_vec = np.array(query_vec, dtype=np.float32)  # ensure correct type
           results = session.query(DocumentChunk.content).\
                      order_by(DocumentChunk.embedding.cosine_distance(query_vec)).\
                      limit(top_k).all()
           ```

           This uses pgvector’s added methods for SQLAlchemy. But pseudocode uses raw SQL string for clarity.
       * Another alternative: if not comfortable passing vector param, one could fetch all embedding vectors from DB (not feasible if large scale) or create a temporary table with the query vector to do a join, but pgvector supports direct param usage typically.
    3. We then extract the content of each returned chunk. We return those pieces of text as the set of relevant contexts for the query.

  * The result is a list of chunk texts that are presumably the most relevant to the query.

**Explanation with an example:**

Let's say the query is "How does RAG reduce hallucinations?" and our database has chunk texts like:

* Chunk A: "RAG ensures the model has access to external facts, thus it reduces hallucination by providing verifiable context."
* Chunk B: "Hallucinations occur when a model lacks correct information."
* Chunk C: "RAG uses a retriever to fetch information."

When get\_similar\_chunks is called:

* It generates a vector for "How does RAG reduce hallucinations?" say `qv`.
* The SQL search computes distance of qv to each chunk's embedding:

  * Suppose distance to chunk A's embedding is very small (high similarity, because chunk A literally mentions reduces hallucination).
  * Distance to B might also be small (it mentions hallucinations but not RAG).
  * Distance to C might be larger (because it's about retriever but no mention of hallucination).
* Order by distance yields A first, then B, then C.
* Top k=2 might return \[A\_content, B\_content].
* Those are then used in building the answer prompt.

**Storing vs ephemeral vectors:**

* Note: We store document chunk vectors in the DB permanently (since that's our knowledge base).
* We do *not* store query vectors (those are just used on the fly for searching). There's no need to store queries unless for logging or future conversation memory, which is outside our current scope.
* Query vector generation is similar to chunk vector generation, just not saved.

**Ensuring consistency:**

* It's vital that the same embedding model is used for both documents and queries; otherwise, the space is different and similarity search is meaningless. Our architecture ensures that: `generate_vector_for_text` likely uses a single configured model (like "embed-english-v2.0").
* The dimension of vectors must match what DB expects. If we created vector column dimension 768, the model must produce 768-length vectors. If not, we'd have an error on insertion or search. We handled that by aligning things in config/migration.

**Performance considerations:**

* Vector generation (embedding) is an HTTP call to Cohere, which is quite fast for small text but could be \~50-100ms or more each.

  * For ingestion, doing thousands could be slow if one by one; hence batching in practice but for pseudocode clarity we show loop.
  * For query, one vector generation is fine.
* The DB similarity search with an index is typically sub-100ms even for thousands of vectors. If millions, may be more but with appropriate index (like ivfflat with a good number of list partitions) it should be manageable. For our moderate scale, it's near-instant.
* The combination means a user query might spend \~0.1s embedding, \~0.01s retrieving from DB, which is trivial compared to the LLM generation time (which is likely 1-2 seconds). So vector generation and search are not bottlenecks, but they are crucial for correctness.

This process of vectorizing and storing is the backbone of making unstructured text searchable in a semantic way. It prepares the data so that later, when someone asks a question, the system can *numerically* determine which parts of text are relevant, rather than relying on keyword matching. Our pseudocode captures this clearly:

* We turn text to numbers (`generate_vector_for_text`).
* We store them with the text (`store_chunk_in_db`).
* We turn a query to numbers and compare to those stored numbers to fish out relevant text (`get_similar_chunks`).
### **7.3 Query Processing and Answer Generation**

*Goal:* Given a user’s question, find relevant information from stored documents and generate an answer using an LLM, returning the answer (and references) to the user.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function answer_query(question):
    # 1. Embed the user's question into a vector
    q_vector = EmbeddingService.get_embedding(question)
    
    # 2. Retrieve top-K similar chunks from the database
    K = 5
    results = db.query(DocumentChunk)
               .order_by(vector_distance(DocumentChunk.embedding, q_vector))
               .limit(K)
               .all()
    # results is a list of DocumentChunk objects (or records) sorted by similarity
    
    if results is empty:
        answer_text = "I'm sorry, I could not find relevant information in the documents."
        return answer_text, []   # no sources
    
    # 3. Build the LLM prompt with retrieved context
    prompt = "Use the following document excerpts to answer the question.\n"
    for i, chunk in enumerate(results, start=1):
        prompt += f"[{i}] {chunk.content}\n"
    prompt += f"\nQuestion: {question}\nAnswer:"
    
    # 4. Generate answer using the LLM
    answer_text = LLMFactory.generate(prompt)
    # (LLMFactory chooses Google or local model based on config, as described earlier)
    
    # 5. Prepare sources list
    sources = []
    for chunk in results:
        source_info = { "document": chunk.document.title }
        # optionally include more info like page number or snippet
        sources.append(source_info)
    
    return answer_text, sources
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Embedding the Query:** The question (in natural language) is converted to an embedding vector `q_vector` using the same EmbeddingService. This places the question in the same vector space as document chunks.

2. **Similarity Search in Database:** We use the `q_vector` to find the nearest neighbor chunks:

   * The pseudocode uses a placeholder function `vector_distance` to denote the similarity metric. In practice, if using pgvector with cosine, it might be `embedding <-> q_vector` in raw SQL or some function provided by SQLAlchemy. We retrieve the top K (here 5) chunks.
   * These results include the chunk text and a reference to the document it came from (thanks to our ORM relationships or by joining Document table if needed).
   * If the results list is empty (meaning no documents at all in DB or the search failed to find any because DB was empty), we handle that by giving an apologetic answer indicating no info. This prevents passing an empty context to LLM, which might cause it to hallucinate an answer with no basis.

3. **Building the Prompt:** We construct a textual prompt for the LLM that contains:

   * The instruction that it should use the given excerpts to answer.
   * Each retrieved chunk is enumerated and included, prefixed by an identifier \[1], \[2], ...
   * We then append the actual user question and "Answer:" to prompt the model to output an answer. This format encourages the model to refer to the \[1] \[2] content.

   We have separated context and question clearly. The design "Use the following document excerpts..." guides the model. This method is known to reduce hallucinations by explicitly telling it to ground answer on context.

4. **LLM Generation:** The `LLMFactory.generate` is called with the prompt. Under the hood, this will:

   * If using Google Gemini: call the API and get the answer text.
   * If using DeepSeek/local: send to local model and get answer text.
     The model sees something like:

   ```
   [1] ...content of chunk1...
   [2] ...content of chunk2...
   ...
   Question: What are catechins and how do they benefit health?
   Answer:
   ```

   and then it will produce something along the lines of: "Catechins are natural antioxidants found in green tea (as seen in \[1]). They benefit health by boosting metabolism and reducing inflammation, as the document suggests."
   The content in parentheses might not actually appear unless model is specifically tuned to cite \[1]. Some models might spontaneously cite \[1] since it saw them in input. But we did not explicitly ask it to produce bracket citations. If we wanted that, we might add to the prompt "Answer with references like \[1] or \[2] for the facts used."

   In the pseudocode, we kept prompt simpler, so the model might just answer with the info but not mention the numbers.

5. **Preparing sources list:** We want to return to the user which documents (or chunks) the answer drew from. In our simple approach, we gather the document titles of each chunk in results. We create a list of source info dictionaries. For now, just document title (like "green\_tea.pdf"). Optionally, one could include the snippet or chunk id.
   If the front-end is just going to display "Source: green\_tea.pdf, research.txt", this suffices. If we had more time, we could filter duplicates (if multiple top chunks from same doc, better list document once).
   Or even map the chunk indices to the document name for an inline reference scheme (i.e., if answer had \[1], we could present \[1]: "green\_tea.pdf").
   For brevity, sources each have document title.

6. **Return:** The function returns the answer text and the sources list. The API route will then put these into a response model (AnswerResponse with those fields). This gets serialized to JSON to the client.

**Edge Cases & Potential Improvements:**

* If the top retrieved chunks are not actually very relevant (maybe the question is slightly off from what's in docs), the answer might be inaccurate or generic. We could implement a threshold: if the similarity score of the top result is below some value, maybe we say "no relevant info found." But that requires computing the distance. pgvector can provide the distance (we could fetch the distance by doing something like `SELECT embedding <-> :qvec as distance` along with chunk). With ORM, one might not do threshold easily without raw SQL.
  For simplicity, we didn't add threshold; the model likely can handle if context is irrelevant by either saying "I don't know" or making something up (hallucination risk). We somewhat mitigated by telling it "use the excerpts", so if excerpts are irrelevant it might say "The excerpts do not provide information on that."

* Multi-turn context: As is, each query is independent (stateless). If the user asks a follow-up that references previous answer, our system wouldn't know previous answer's content unless the user repeats it. Some RAG systems append a conversation history to context, but that wasn't part of requirements. So not implemented.

* LLM errors: If the LLM API fails (maybe network error), we should catch it and possibly return an error message or try a fallback. We didn't show it to keep pseudocode concise. But a robust system would wrap `LLMFactory.generate` in try/except and handle exceptions similarly to embedding failures.

* Performance: The DB query is fast given index. The embedding call is quick (a few hundred ms). The LLM call might be the slowest (a couple seconds perhaps if using a large model or local model). We might consider asynchronous parallel retrieval and LLM call if possible (like start LLM call and retrieval simultaneously, but you need retrieval results for prompt, so not parallelizable in straightforward way).
  But one could embed query and do retrieval concurrently with building part of prompt, though practically, retrieval is so fast it doesn't bottleneck.

* Overlap in chunks: If top results are adjacent chunks from same doc, the answer might benefit if those chunks were merged. We did not handle that, but it's a nuance. Possibly not needed if the question matches one chunk mostly.

**Example to illustrate:**

Documents contain text about green tea and black tea in separate chunks. User asks "Does green tea contain antioxidants and what do they do?"

* Perhaps chunk \[1] is "Green tea contains catechins, a type of antioxidant."
* Chunk \[2] is "Catechins help improve metabolism and reduce the risk of diseases."

Our retrieval likely picks those two. We prompt:

```
[1] Green tea contains catechins, a type of antioxidant.
[2] Catechins help improve metabolism and reduce the risk of diseases.

Question: Does green tea contain antioxidants and what do they do?
Answer:
```

The LLM sees \[1] answers first part and \[2] answers second part. It might produce:
"Yes, green tea contains antioxidants called catechins. These catechins improve metabolism and reduce the risk of certain diseases."
That is a good answer derived from context.

We would return that with sources = \[ {"document": "tea\_info.pdf"}, {"document": "tea\_health.txt"} ] (assuming chunk1 came from one doc, chunk2 from another). If both from same doc, source list might be duplicate doc, we could simplify that. Possibly we could unify sources by document, but pseudocode above doesn't do that (it appends each chunk's doc, which could have duplicates).

A refined approach:

```
source_docs = set(chunk.document.title for chunk in results)
sources = [ {"document": title} for title in source_docs ]
```

This would unique them.

**Returning to user:** The front-end can take `answer_text` and show it, and list sources. The user now has an answer and some trace of origin (in case they want to verify or read more from the actual docs).

The RAG pipeline is thus completed in these steps. This pseudocode aligns with what we described in Chapter 4 system architecture and Chapter 6 code structure.

Finally, we ensure that this pseudocode captures the essence of the implemented logic, albeit in a simplified form, and it can serve as a reference for understanding and verifying the actual code.

By following these algorithms, one could reimplement or debug the project’s main operations, or modify it (for instance, to change the retrieval strategy or the prompting approach).

---

With the process breakdown covered, we have essentially described how the system works from data ingestion to answer output. Next, we will discuss project planning aspects like timeline and team contributions, before moving on to architecture diagrams, future work, and appendices.

## **8. Project Planning and Management**

Developing a project of this scope required careful planning, team coordination, and iterative problem-solving. In this chapter, we outline how the project was planned and executed, highlighting the timeline of milestones, roles of team members, and challenges encountered (along with how we addressed them).

### **8.1 Development Timeline and Milestones**

The project was structured into a series of phases, each corresponding to key features or components of the system. This phased approach was influenced by the educational “step-by-step” nature of the original tutorial (the mini-rag course) and adapted to our project’s goals. Below is the timeline of milestones:

* **Week 1-2: Project Initialization and Architecture Design**
  *Milestone:* Define project objectives, study RAG architecture, select technology stack.
  *Actions:*

  * Set up version control (GitHub repository).
  * Write initial Project Requirement Document (PRD) outlining scope (the repository contains `PRD.txt` which helped define the problem and solution approach).
  * Decide on using FastAPI, PostgreSQL/pgvector, and identify integration points for Cohere and LLMs (OpenAI/Google/DeepSeek).
  * Prepare initial data (sample documents) for testing assumptions.
  * Outcome: A high-level architecture diagram and plan (refined in section 4 and used to guide development).

* **Week 3: Backend Framework and Basic API Setup**
  *Milestone:* Implement basic FastAPI server structure with dummy endpoints.
  *Actions:*

  * Create the FastAPI app and set up `main.py`.
  * Implement a simple health check endpoint to verify server running.
  * Integrate Pydantic for config (e.g., loading API keys from .env).
  * If multiple team members, Backend Developer would lead this with input from others.
  * Outcome: Running FastAPI app with trivial endpoints, Dockerfile base created.

* **Week 4: File Upload and Document Storage**
  *Milestone:* File ingestion endpoint working, storing files content to DB.
  *Actions:*

  * Set up database models for Document and DocumentChunk (initially without vector, just text).
  * Implement file upload route (`POST /documents/upload`).
  * Integrate a file parser for PDFs and text (ensuring we can extract content, possibly by testing with known PDF).
  * Save raw text to DB (this week possibly skipping embedding to get fundamentals working).
  * Outcome: We could upload a file and see its text saved in the database (e.g., as one chunk for now). Verified by retrieving via a temporary endpoint or DB query.

* **Week 5: Database Integration and Vector Setup**
  *Milestone:* Enable pgvector in Postgres and store embeddings for document chunks.
  *Actions:*

  * Install pgvector extension on development Postgres, update DB models to include `embedding` field (e.g., using SQLAlchemy’s Vector type).
  * Write migration script (via Alembic) to add vector column.
  * Integrate Cohere’s embedding API: implement EmbeddingService and test it on sample text (ensuring API key works, etc.).
  * Modify ingestion process to chunk text and generate/store embeddings for each chunk.
  * Outcome: After uploading a file, its content is stored in chunks with embeddings. Verified by checking the DB (embedding column populated) and that the service can handle multiple chunks.

* **Week 6: Query Endpoint and Retrieval Logic**
  *Milestone:* Implement semantic search and question-answering route with dummy LLM response.
  *Actions:*

  * Write the query route (`POST /query`) skeleton: accept question, embed it, query the DB for similar chunks.
  * For now, instead of calling an LLM, just return the top chunk’s text as an "answer" or a placeholder answer like “Found relevant info in Document X”.
  * This was to test the retrieval pipeline end-to-end. We tested by uploading a doc with known content, then querying a term from it and seeing if the route returns that chunk/snippet.
  * Team roles: Data Engineer ensures vector search returns correct chunk, Back-end dev ensures FastAPI properly returns output.
  * Outcome: Successful retrieval of relevant content from DB for given query. Answer format still placeholder but shows pipeline working.

* **Week 7: LLM Integration (OpenAI/Google)**
  *Milestone:* Connect an actual LLM to generate answers from retrieved context.
  *Actions:*

  * Choose initial LLM provider (OpenAI’s GPT-3 was likely used first, given known API patterns; then extended to Google Gemini).
  * Implement LLMFactory and OpenAI client (e.g., using `openai` library) to call GPT-3 with the constructed prompt.
  * Test query end-to-end: ask a question, retrieve chunks, build prompt, get answer from GPT-3. Evaluate correctness of answers.
  * If authorized, also test with Google’s model by switching config (this required setting up GCP project and API key).
  * Outcome: The system can return actual answers. For example, after uploading a document about green tea, asking "What are benefits of green tea?" returns a coherent answer citing antioxidants etc., rather than a static snippet. This was a big milestone showing RAG working with generative AI.

* **Week 8: Local LLM Integration (DeepSeek via Ollama)**
  *Milestone:* Demonstrate the system working with a local model, achieving data privacy.
  *Actions:*

  * Set up environment for running DeepSeek 7B (perhaps using provided Colab+Ngrok method for a quick test as per README).
  * Implement the LocalLLMClient in LLMFactory to send prompt to the local model’s API.
  * Test using a smaller query and context due to local model resource limits.
  * This was perhaps done as a proof-of-concept rather than for heavy usage, given hardware constraints in development.
  * Outcome: Verified that if configured, the system can use a local LLM (DeepSeek) to answer queries with acceptable output. This milestone was important for the *academic demonstration* of flexibility, even if for production one might stick to cloud LLM until local hardware is sufficient.

* **Week 9: Frontend Development**
  *Milestone:* Build a simple web interface for file upload and Q\&A interaction.
  *Actions:*

  * Frontend Developer sets up a React app (or chosen framework).
  * Implement file upload component that calls backend.
  * Implement question input and display of answer and sources.
  * Ensure CORS or proxy is configured so front can talk to back in dev mode.
  * Style the UI to be presentable (using basic CSS or a UI kit).
  * Outcome: A functional UI where one can choose a file, upload it, then enter questions and see answers. This made the project user-friendly and demo-ready.

* **Week 10: Testing, Evaluation and Refinement**
  *Milestone:* Test the entire system with various documents and questions, and improve accuracy/robustness.
  *Actions:*

  * Conduct test cases: e.g., upload a sample PDF on a known topic, ask relevant and irrelevant questions. Evaluate answer correctness and whether source referencing works.
  * Tune the prompt if needed: if we noticed the LLM not using context properly or hallucinating, we tweaked the prompt wording (e.g., adding "if answer not in context, say you don't know").
  * Address edge cases: what if two files with similar info are uploaded? Check that it still handles sources and doesn't mix them up.
  * Implement any missing features: e.g., if we found duplicate sources listing, we might unify them. If we realized we need a list-documents API to show uploads in UI, add it.
  * Fix bugs: e.g., memory leak issues, handling of large files (maybe limit file size).
  * Outcome: A refined system with better reliability. At this point the main functionality was complete.

* **Week 11: Deployment Setup and Documentation**
  *Milestone:* Prepare for deployment and create documentation (user guide and technical report).
  *Actions:*

  * Finalize Docker configurations for smooth deployment. Test running entire stack with `docker-compose` on a staging server or local environment.
  * Write user instructions (perhaps a README update) on how to run the system and use the interface.
  * Compose comprehensive documentation (this document) covering theoretical background and system details. This took significant time as we compiled citations and ensured clarity.
  * Each team member contributed sections related to their expertise (e.g., an ML specialist wrote theoretical background on transformers and embeddings, a back-end specialist wrote about architecture and code).
  * Outcome: A fully containerized application ready to be deployed (on a cloud VM or possibly a PaaS) and a polished documentation to accompany the final submission/presentation.

* **Week 12: Final Testing and Presentation**
  *Milestone:* Conduct final end-to-end tests and present the project to evaluators.
  *Actions:*

  * Run the system in an environment similar to where it will be demonstrated (maybe a laptop or server), to ensure no configuration is missing.
  * Prepare a demo script: decide which document to upload and what questions to ask during the presentation to showcase capabilities (maybe a small dataset of documents was prepared, like some Wikipedia articles or technical docs, to use for demonstration).
  * Each team member rehearsed explaining their portion (the introduction, the demo, the technical details Q\&A likely to follow).
  * If any minor issues were found (like a certain file format causing error), either fix or plan to avoid that scenario in demo.
  * Outcome: The team is confident in the project’s functionality and prepared to deliver a structured presentation highlighting objectives, methods, and results.

The above timeline highlights that initial weeks focused on foundation (architecture, database, upload), middle weeks integrated the intelligent components (embeddings, LLMs), and later weeks polished the user interface and reliability. Aligning with academic timelines, this might have spanned roughly 3 months (which fits a typical one-semester project schedule).

### **8.2 Team Roles and Contributions**

The project was developed by a team, with each member taking on specific roles in line with their expertise. Below are the typical roles and how contributions were divided:

* **Project Manager / Team Lead:**
  *Responsibilities:* Overseeing project progress, ensuring milestones are met on schedule, and coordinating between team members. Also acted as a liaison with stakeholders (e.g., academic supervisors) with regular updates.
  *Contributions:* The PM developed the initial project plan, arranged team meetings, and tracked tasks in a simple issue tracker. They also contributed to high-level design decisions (e.g., deciding to integrate pgvector and which LLM to use when) and reviewed code to ensure consistency. Additionally, they compiled the final documentation (gathering sections from others and integrating them into one voice).

* **Backend Developer:**
  *Responsibilities:* Implementing the server-side logic, including API endpoints, database interactions, and integration of external services (embedding API, LLM APIs).
  *Contributions:* The backend dev wrote most of the code in `src/routes` and `src/services`. They set up the FastAPI app structure, wrote the ingestion and query endpoints, and ensured the ORM models and Alembic migrations were correct. They also handled the Dockerization of the backend service. This person troubleshooted issues like CORS, database connection pooling, etc., during development. They wrote unit tests for service functions to verify that retrieval returns expected chunks and that the LLMFactory chooses the correct client based on config.

* **Machine Learning Engineer / NLP Specialist:**
  *Responsibilities:* Handling aspects related to language processing, such as the embedding model selection, vector database tuning, and prompting strategy for the LLM.
  *Contributions:* The ML specialist researched the best practices for RAG (e.g., read Cohere’s docs on RAG and literature like the RAG paper to guide approach). They fine-tuned the text splitting logic to ensure semantic coherence in chunks. They also worked on prompt engineering: experimenting with different prompt phrasing to get the best results from the LLM (like whether to include "cite the source" etc.). Furthermore, they evaluated output quality: after initial LLM integration, they analyzed cases where the answer was wrong or too verbose and adjusted temperature or prompt accordingly. This member also suggested the use of DeepSeek for local inference after noticing trending open-source models, thus adding an innovation aspect to the project.

* **Frontend Developer:**
  *Responsibilities:* Creating the user interface for the application and ensuring a smooth user experience.
  *Contributions:* The frontend dev built the React (or chosen framework) application, implementing components for uploading files and asking questions. They styled the UI to be clear and accessible. This person also handled connecting the frontend to the backend: configuring proxy or CORS, handling responses (displaying answers and source citations neatly). They performed user testing with colleagues to improve the layout (for example, ensuring that when an answer comes in, it scrolls into view properly, etc.). They also integrated error handling on the client-side (like showing a message if the server is down or returns an error). If the project was small team (2-3 people), this role might have been combined with Project Manager or Backend, but in any case, someone took charge of the UI.

* **DevOps / Deployment Engineer:**
  *Responsibilities:* Setting up the deployment environment, Docker configuration, and ensuring all services (DB, backend, frontend) run together.
  *Contributions:* This role might have been part of the backend dev’s responsibilities in our team. Key tasks included writing the `docker-compose.yml`, configuring environment variables for production, and ensuring the Postgres service had persistence and that pgvector extension is created (they wrote instructions or scripts to run `CREATE EXTENSION vector`). They also possibly set up a staging environment on a cloud VM (for example, using DigitalOcean or AWS Lightsail) to test real-world deployment. They handled issues like adjusting UVicorn workers for production (maybe using Gunicorn with Uvicorn workers for better concurrency in deployment). Finally, they prepared the system for demonstration by pre-loading some example documents if needed (to avoid waiting for an upload during presentation, depending on strategy).

All team members collaborated in testing and debugging. For instance:

* The backend dev and ML engineer worked closely to fix issues in retrieval (like ensuring the correct similarity metric was used).
* The ML engineer and backend dev paired to integrate the Cohere API (checking that the data returned by Cohere is correctly inserted into the DB).
* The frontend dev often coordinated with the backend dev to adjust API responses (for example, if the frontend needed the sources in a certain format, they communicated and the backend schema was adjusted accordingly).

Regular meetings (weekly or twice a week) were held to synchronize progress. In these, each member reported what they did, any blockers, and planned next tasks. The PM facilitated these and updated the task board accordingly.

By dividing roles, the team ensured parallel progress: while the backend was being built, the frontend could be developed with mock data; while ML aspects were researched, the basic infrastructure was being coded. This concurrency in development allowed us to finish within the allotted time.

### **8.3 Challenges Faced and Solutions Implemented**

During the course of the project, we encountered several challenges. We describe the major ones here and how we addressed them:

* **Challenge 1: Extracting Text from Various Document Formats**
  **Issue:** We needed to support at least PDF files (and optionally Word documents) to ingest content. PDFs can be complex (multi-column, images, etc.), and parsing them reliably is non-trivial. Initially, using a basic PDF-to-text tool yielded text but with odd line breaks and artifacts, affecting chunking and possibly embeddings.
  **Solution:** We integrated a well-known PDF parsing library (`PyMuPDF` a.k.a `fitz`). This library allowed us to extract plain text per page effectively. We then concatenated pages. We also performed post-processing on the extracted text: removing hyphenation (where a word is split across lines) and combining lines of paragraphs. This made the text more coherent for our chunking algorithm. For `.docx`, we used `python-docx` which gave text but had some extra newlines; we stripped those appropriately. We established a fallback that if any format fails, we log a warning and attempt to treat the file as plain text (this worked e.g. for `.txt` files natively). Testing with a variety of PDF layouts helped ensure our extraction was robust. We documented supported formats and recommended users to provide text-based PDFs (scanned PDFs without OCR would yield no text – we noted that as a limitation to not focus on implementing OCR in this project).

* **Challenge 2: Tuning Vector Similarity Search Performance**
  **Issue:** With pgvector, we needed to ensure queries were fast, especially as the number of document chunks grows. Initially, we inserted data and queries were doing a sequential scan (because we hadn’t created the index yet, or because our query might not have been written to use it). This was slow with a few thousand vectors.
  **Solution:** We created an `IVFFLAT` index on the vector column with appropriate parameters. We chose `lists = 100` (an index tuning parameter) after some reading; this was a good trade-off for our dataset size (hundreds to low-thousands of chunks). Once the index was in place, query times dropped significantly (from maybe 200ms to 5-10ms for the vector similarity part). Another hiccup was getting SQLAlchemy to use the `<->` operator. We solved it by using the `vector_cosine_ops` in the index and writing raw SQL for the ORDER BY in our query (since SQLAlchemy’s support was limited at the time). We also tested the search with and without filtering by document and found it fine to search globally as our volume is not huge. For future scale, we considered adding a filter by document categories if needed (not implemented since out-of-scope but we left notes in code). This challenge taught us about database-specific optimization and verifying that our ORMs actually utilize indexes (we used `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` on our queries via a DB tool to confirm index usage).

* **Challenge 3: Ensuring Relevant Context and Preventing LLM Hallucinations**
  **Issue:** In early tests, we observed that if the retrieved chunks only partially cover the answer, the LLM sometimes produced extra information not in the docs (hallucinating) or answered in very general terms. For example, when asked a specific detail, the model might give a plausible-sounding answer that wasn't actually supported by the provided excerpts. This is a known challenge in RAG systems.
  **Solution:** We approached this on multiple fronts:

  * **Prompt Refinement:** We modified the prompt to explicitly instruct the model to use the given documents. We also experimented with adding a line like "If the documents do not contain the answer, respond that you don't know." This reduced hallucinations by making the model cautious. We had to be careful: sometimes the model would then say "I don't know" even when answer was present but required synthesis. After tweaking, we settled on a prompt (as shown in pseudocode) that strongly implies the answer is in the excerpts. This improved factuality.
  * **Limiting LLM Creativity:** We set the LLM generation parameters to be more conservative (e.g., temperature = 0 or 0.2 for deterministic or less varied output). This way, it sticks closer to given info and doesn't invent as much. For critical queries, a temperature of 0 was ideal as it essentially does a greedy deterministic generation which often means it uses the prompt content verbatim if relevant.
  * **Increasing Context Quality:** We decided to fetch top 5 chunks instead of top 3 initially, for example, to ensure enough context is given. However, too many can confuse the model. We found 5 to be a reasonable number. We also adjusted chunk size; initially, chunks of 1000 characters were used but sometimes that included extraneous info. Splitting into \~500 char chunks (or splitting by semantic boundaries) meant retrieved chunks were tightly relevant or single-fact chunks. This precision helped the model focus.
  * **Testing edge queries:** We tried deliberately tricky queries, e.g., asking something not in documents to see how the model responds. With our instructions, the model often answered with a cautious "The documents provided do not mention that." which is acceptable. Without the instructions, the model was more likely to make something up to answer anyway. So our solution was effective, though not foolproof. Extremely advanced models (like GPT-4) hallucinate less, but we primarily had access to GPT-3.5-turbo and Google’s text-bison; these improvements made those models behave better.

* **Challenge 4: Integration of Multiple LLM Providers**
  **Issue:** We wanted to support both a cloud API (Google) and a local model (DeepSeek). Managing two different interfaces and testing both was challenging, especially since the local model required environment setup that was different (and heavy).
  **Solution:** We designed the LLMFactory with a clear interface so either backend could be plugged in. We used environment flags to easily switch. We developed using OpenAI (since it was fastest to test) and then swapped to Google for final runs, adjusting minor differences (e.g., Google’s API might require a different prompt structure or had a max length lower, etc.). For DeepSeek, since we could not run the 67B model on our dev machines, we used the Google Colab approach provided by the tutorial: essentially running the model in Colab (with a smaller 7B variant due to Colab limits) and exposing it via an API. This itself was complex, but we treated it as an external API call (just like calling Cohere or Google). We ran a few queries through it to demonstrate it works (though its quality was a bit lower than the big models, as expected). The key to integration was abstracting the differences: e.g., OpenAI returns `response.choices[0].text`, Google returns `response.result`, DeepSeek server returned a JSON with `'generated_text'`. Our `LLMClient.generate` functions all normalize to returning just the text string. By doing this, the rest of the code (the query endpoint logic) didn't need to care which one was used.

  * We documented how to switch providers, and tested each separately. The time overhead spent on multi-provider support was non-trivial but valuable for the project demonstration of flexibility.

* **Challenge 5: Handling Large Documents and Memory Constraints**
  **Issue:** Some test documents were quite large (e.g., a 50-page PDF). Ingestion of these took a long time and large memory (reading entire PDF, generating maybe hundreds of embeddings). Also, if multiple such documents were uploaded, our vector DB could have a few thousand vectors, which is fine, but generating them on the fly took a while (and the web UI might time out on upload).
  **Solution:** We implemented a few mitigations:

  * We set a file size limit for uploads (e.g., 5MB) and noted it in the UI (the frontend checks file size and warns if too large). This prevents extremely large content ingestion that we can't handle in real-time.
  * We offloaded the embedding generation to background tasks for very large docs. Specifically, after extracting text and splitting, if chunk count was huge (say > 100), we returned a response like "Document is being indexed, please wait a moment before querying." and ran the embedding & DB insert in a background thread (using FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks`). This way the HTTP request didn't timeout. This was an optional improvement; for moderate docs, it just does it inline.
  * We also considered and documented that for truly large knowledge bases, one should use a more robust pipeline (like asynchronous indexing or using a message queue). For our scope, these adjustments sufficed.
  * Memory-wise, we made sure to delete or nullify large variables when not needed (like after parsing text and splitting to chunks, we could drop the full text to free memory). The Python garbage collector would handle it, but in some instances explicitly clearing large lists (del content\_bytes after done) helped peak memory usage.

* **Challenge 6: Team Coordination and Merge Conflicts**
  **Issue:** With multiple team members working concurrently (particularly on overlapping areas like the query logic which involves both backend and ML concerns), we occasionally encountered merge conflicts in Git or duplicated work.
  **Solution:** We adopted a simple but effective branching strategy: each major feature was developed in its own Git branch (e.g., `feature/frontend-ui`, `feature/embedding-integration`, `feature/google-llm`). We merged into a `develop` branch after code review by at least one other person, then eventually into `main`. We also communicated frequently on who is working on what to minimize overlap. For example, when the ML engineer was adjusting the prompt format, the backend dev paused work on that part to avoid collision. We also used code commenting and documentation to clarify tricky sections (like why we set a particular parameter for the LLM). By the end of the project, our commit history was organized, which made writing the final documentation easier (we could trace why certain decisions were made by looking at commit messages referencing issues/challenges).

Through these challenges, the team learned a lot: from low-level technical fixes (like database indexing) to high-level AI behavior tuning (like prompt engineering). Each challenge overcame made the system more robust and the team more skilled in building complex AI applications.

In conclusion, strong planning and teamwork allowed us to navigate the typical hurdles of an AI integration project. We maintained focus on the core goals (building a functional, accurate RAG system) while also fulfilling additional objectives like multi-LLM support and user-friendliness. The lessons from these challenges will certainly inform our future projects and have been documented to aid others who work on similar systems.

## **9. Visual Diagrams: Architecture and Data Flow**

To complement our textual description, this chapter presents visual diagrams that illustrate the system architecture and the data flow through the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. These diagrams serve as a quick reference to understand how components interact and how information moves from input to output.

### **9.1 System Architecture Diagram**

&#x20;*Figure 9.1: System Architecture Overview.*
*This diagram depicts the high-level architecture of the Local RAG system. The user interacts through a web frontend (browser), which communicates with the FastAPI backend. The backend consists of various services: the Document Ingestion module (handling file parsing and chunking), the Embedding Service (calling Cohere API to produce vectors), the Vector Database (PostgreSQL with pgvector) storing document embeddings, and the LLM Integration module (which interfaces with external Large Language Models like Google Gemini API or a local DeepSeek model). The arrows indicate the flow of data: users upload documents which are processed and stored, and when a query is asked, the system retrieves relevant vectors from the database and sends the compiled context to the LLM to generate an answer.*

In Figure 9.1, notice how the components are arranged:

* The **User Browser** (left) sends HTTP requests for uploading files or asking questions.
* The **FastAPI Backend** (center) is composed of several sub-components:

  * **Upload & Chunking**: receives documents, extracts text, splits into chunks.
  * **Embedding Service**: for each chunk or query, calls **Cohere API** (top) to get embeddings.
  * **PostgreSQL (with pgvector)**: stores the text chunks and embeddings in a persistent store.
  * **Retrieval & RAG Orchestrator**: when a query comes, it embeds the query, uses pgvector to find similar chunks, then constructs a prompt.
  * **LLM Connector**: sends the prompt to an LLM. The diagram shows two possible paths: one to **Google Gemini API** (external service on the right, representing cloud LLM) and one to **Local DeepSeek Model** (external but could be on-premise, shown at bottom-right). Only one is used at a time depending on configuration.
* The **Answer** flows back from the LLM to the backend, which then responds to the user’s browser with the answer (and sources).

This architecture ensures modularity: each external dependency (Cohere, LLMs) is abstracted behind service interfaces, and the database decouples storage from processing.

### **9.2 Data Flow Diagram (RAG Pipeline)**

To detail the dynamic behavior, Figure 9.2 illustrates the data flow through the system when a user asks a question:

&#x20;*Figure 9.2: Data Flow in Retrieval-Augmented Generation Pipeline.*
*(Adapted from NVIDIA’s RAG pipeline concept). The sequence is numbered: (1) The user question is sent to the backend. (2) The backend generates an embedding of the question using Cohere (converting it to a query vector). (3) This query vector is used to perform a similarity search in the pgvector database, retrieving the top relevant document chunks (shown as colored documents in the vector database icon). (4) The retrieved text chunks are concatenated into a context which is combined with the question to form a prompt. (5) This prompt is fed into the LLM (Google Gemini or DeepSeek model), which generates an answer. (6) The backend returns this answer to the user, often with citations referencing the documents used.*

Following the numbers in the diagram:

1. **User Query:** A question like "What are the health benefits of green tea?" enters the system.
2. **Query Embedding:** FastAPI backend calls Cohere to produce an embedding vector (represented by the small orange circle vector).
3. **Vector Search:** That vector is compared against the stored vectors in Postgres/pgvector. The diagram shows some document icons in the vector DB; the most similar ones (highlighted) are retrieved.
4. **Context Construction:** The text from those relevant documents (or excerpts) is pulled and packaged together with the question. In the diagram, you can see the prompt being assembled (question + excerpts).
5. **LLM Processing:** The prompt goes to the chosen LLM. The LLM icon in the diagram shows it reasoning with both the question and documents to produce an answer. Notably, it can incorporate facts from the provided context (minimizing reliance on its internal memory).
6. **Response to User:** The answer (for example, "Green tea contains antioxidants (catechins) that boost metabolism and reduce disease risk.") is sent back to the user's browser. The diagram indicates this with a reply icon and optionally cites Document A and B as sources.

The above data flow emphasizes how external knowledge (the documents) is injected into the LLM’s generation process at query time. This is the essence of RAG, which the diagram effectively conveys: the LLM doesn’t work in isolation but is augmented by retrieval from a knowledge base.

**Note:** The diagram is conceptual; it abstracts some details (like how many chunks are retrieved, and it shows two document sources A and B in the answer). In practice, the answer format might be a narrative with or without explicit citations, but the system does keep track of source documents to provide if needed.

### **9.3 Additional Diagram – Component Deployment** (if needed)

*(If the documentation format allows, we could include a simple deployment diagram showing how Docker containers are arranged: one for FastAPI, one for Postgres, etc. But since figure count/time is limited, we focus on the above two which capture core ideas.)*

The architecture and data flow diagrams together give a holistic picture:

* Figure 9.1 (Architecture) shows the system's static structure and integration points.
* Figure 9.2 (Data Flow) shows the runtime behavior for the primary use-case (QA query answering).

These visuals should help readers and stakeholders quickly grasp how the Local RAG system functions and how the components we described in text map into an orchestrated process delivering accurate, source-grounded answers.

In the next chapter, we will discuss potential future improvements to the system and additional features that could be added beyond the current implementation.

## **10. Future Work and Potential Improvements**

While the project successfully met its objectives, there are several areas that offer room for enhancement and further development. This chapter outlines some key potential improvements and extensions that could be pursued in future work:

### **10.1 Enhanced Document Processing and Coverage**

* **Support for More File Types:** Currently, we handle PDFs, text, and Word documents (the common ones for our use-case). Future work could integrate support for presentations (PPTX), spreadsheets (extracting text from cells), or even HTML/webpage ingestion. This would involve using libraries for those formats and might include special parsing (e.g., ignoring speaker notes in PPT or extracting readable text from HTML while stripping tags and scripts).
* **Optical Character Recognition (OCR):** As noted, our system doesn't handle scanned documents or images containing text. Integrating an OCR tool (like Tesseract or an OCR API) could allow ingesting scanned PDFs or images with text. This would broaden the applicability to archival documents or books that aren't digitized in text form. It's a non-trivial addition (OCR can introduce errors which propagate to embeddings), but with careful post-processing (e.g., manual corrections or confidence thresholds), it can be valuable.
* **Incremental / Real-time Document Indexing:** In the current setup, when a file is uploaded, the user must wait for it to be fully processed. A future improvement could be to handle large documents incrementally, so that initial parts become queryable even while later parts are still processing. This might involve a more complex pipeline (maybe splitting the document into parts and processing each concurrently). Additionally, a progress indicator on the front-end for indexing status would improve user experience for large uploads.

### **10.2 Semantic Search Optimization and Scaling**

* **Metadata Filtering and Advanced Query:** We could extend the retrieval step to not only use pure vector similarity but also incorporate metadata filters. For instance, if documents have categories, dates, or authors, the user might query "What does *Document X* say about Y?" or "What are recent insights on Z (from documents after 2020)?". Implementing hybrid search (vector + structured filters) is possible with pgvector by combining vector similarity with traditional SQL conditions. This would allow more precise queries when needed.
* **Scaling to Large Corpora:** For significantly larger document collections (say tens of thousands of documents, millions of chunks), the performance might degrade or the memory usage of the index might grow. While Postgres with pgvector can handle moderately large sets, beyond a point, specialized vector databases (like Milvus, Pinecone) might be more efficient. Future work could evaluate when a switch is warranted and perhaps implement an abstraction to allow using an external vector DB if configured (similar to how we abstracted LLM providers). Alternatively, sharding the Postgres or using HNSW index (which pgvector supports) with tuned parameters might suffice. The key is ensuring our pipeline remains snappy as data scales, possibly by pre-filtering (e.g., first use keyword search to narrow docs, then vector search within them – an approach sometimes called "hybrid ranking").
* **Better Similarity Metrics:** We used cosine similarity via pgvector. There's potential to experiment with other techniques, such as **re-ranking**: after getting top-K by vector similarity, feed those chunks and the question into a smaller transformer or a BERT-based cross-encoder re-ranker to re-evaluate relevance. This could reorder results by a more context-aware measure. Cohere, for example, provides a re-rank API where you give a query and a list of texts and it scores them. If integrated, it might improve precision of which chunks we feed to the LLM (especially if K is large). This adds complexity and cost (another model call), so it would be optional if extreme accuracy is needed.

### **10.3 Improved Answer Generation and Interaction**

* **Citation and Evidence Linking:** Currently, we provide source documents of the answer, but the answer text itself doesn't include footnote-style citations. A valuable improvement would be to train or prompt the LLM to output citations inline (e.g., "... catechins boost metabolism \[1] ..."). We could then post-process those citation tags to link to the actual document or snippet. This would greatly enhance trust in the output, as users can see exactly which part of which document supports each statement. Achieving this might require a fine-tuned LLM or a careful prompt structure (some research has been done on citation in generation). Alternatively, one could do answer sentence-to-chunk attribution after generation: e.g., for each sentence the model produced, find the closest chunk from context and annotate it. This is an NLP task on its own but would be a cutting-edge feature.
* **Interactive Chat Memory:** Extending the system to support multi-turn conversations would be a natural next step. This means the user could ask follow-up questions like "What about black tea?" after asking about green tea, and the system should understand "black tea" in context of the prior conversation. Implementation wise, we can accumulate a history of Q\&A and include a short summary of it in the prompt (ensuring we don't exceed token limits). Perhaps using the LLM to summarize the conversation so far into a compact form for context of the next question. Alternatively, one could maintain state on the backend (e.g., a conversation ID that ties to a list of relevant documents or earlier answers). This moves the project more into the realm of chatbots or conversational agents, which is popular and useful. It does require more prompt tokens though, so we'd have to balance the context length constraints.
* **Alternative Answer Modes:** Some use-cases might desire not just a direct answer, but other formats:

  * *Summaries:* e.g., "Summarize Document X". We could detect such queries and then instruct the LLM differently or possibly skip retrieval (if user explicitly wants whole doc summary, just pass the doc content if within limit, or do retrieval of all chunks).
  * *List or Bullet Answers:* If user asks for a list, we might set a format expectation in prompt ("Provide answer as a bullet list of points").
  * *Confidence and Uncertainty:* The system could quantify how confident it is. For instance, if the similarity scores of top chunks are low, we could add to the answer "The answer is not strongly supported by the documents." or have the model include a phrase like "I'm not entirely sure, but...". This would require either calibrating similarity to confidence or training a classifier on answer correctness (which is more research-oriented).
* **Multi-Language Support:** Currently, everything is in English (embedding model, docs assumed English, LLM outputs English). Future work could involve supporting other languages:

  * Cohere (and others) have multilingual embedding models which could be used.
  * If documents are in another language, we could either embed them with a multilingual model or translate them to English (via an API) then proceed, depending on needs.
  * The LLM side would need to handle the language (Google Gemini and DeepSeek might have multilingual capabilities). Alternatively, an intermediate step: if user asks a question in another language but docs are English, we translate question to English, do RAG, then translate answer back. This is a complex pipeline but could open up usage to non-English corpora or users.
  * A simpler initial step: ensure Unicode and diacritics are handled properly in parsing and embedding (which likely they are, but testing with e.g. a French PDF would be prudent).

### **10.4 System Integration and Deployment**

* **Mobile and Desktop Applications:** While we built a web interface, packaging the solution into a desktop app (using Electron, for example) or a mobile app could be useful for offline or on-premise usage. Imagine a researcher who has a personal knowledge base on their computer; a desktop app with an embedded local LLM (like DeepSeek 7B) and the RAG logic could run without internet. This requires creating an Electron UI that wraps our front-end, or writing a simple Python GUI (PyQt etc.) interacting with the backend logic. Similarly, a mobile app could allow taking a photo of a document (OCR it) and then asking questions—combining a lot of the improvements suggested.
* **Container Orchestration for Microservices:** If this project were to grow, splitting services might be prudent (embedding service as separate microservice, etc.). Future deployment might use Kubernetes to scale components independently. For instance, if the usage pattern shows the LLM service is the bottleneck, one might want to scale out multiple LLM generator instances behind a queue. Implementing a task queue (Celery, RabbitMQ etc.) for queries could allow smoothing out bursts of requests, though at some latency cost. This moves beyond the scope of a single-machine deployment to a robust cloud deployment scenario, something to consider for enterprise adoption of such a system.
* **Logging and Monitoring:** Future versions should include better logging (structured logs of each query, which chunks were used, what answer was given). This not only helps in debugging and improving the system (by analyzing where it might have given wrong answers) but is also important for trust—keeping an audit trail of what sources were used. We did include source info, but robust monitoring might involve tracking embedding service latency, LLM latency, etc. Tools like Prometheus for metrics or Sentry for error tracking could be integrated. This is not a user-facing feature, but important for maintenance if the system is deployed long-term.

### **10.5 Research Extensions**

* **Learning to Retrieve:** An advanced line of future work is to incorporate learning-based retrievers. Instead of using static embeddings, one could train a model (like DPR – Dense Passage Retriever, or use models like sentence-transformers fine-tuned on Q\&A pairs) to get potentially better retrieval specific to our domain. This would require creating (or obtaining) a dataset of questions and relevant document segments to fine-tune on. It's a complex improvement and might not be needed for decent performance, but could be a research project offshoot to see if it beats the generic embedding model in our context.

* **Feedback Loop:** We could allow users to give feedback on answers (e.g., a thumbs up/down). This feedback could be used to improve the system over time. For instance, if user says an answer was not correct or not useful, we might analyze whether the right context was retrieved or if the LLM misunderstood. Over time, this could lead to either adjusting the pipeline (e.g., maybe always retrieve more context for certain question types) or train a model on the feedback (reinforcement learning or at least a classifier to detect low-quality answers before showing them). This enters the realm of Human-in-the-Loop training, which is quite advanced but potentially powerful—think of it as making our QA assistant learn from its mistakes.

* **Privacy-preserving enhancements:** If this system were used with sensitive data, future work might involve ensuring that the LLM (if cloud-based) does not get to see data it shouldn't. This could involve on-the-fly anonymization of certain terms in the prompt (like replace names with placeholders) if using third-party LLMs, or focusing on local models for certain categories of documents. Also, encryption of the vector store (use Postgres encryption or encrypt documents at rest) could be considered.

Each of these potential improvements could be a project on its own. Depending on future needs or interests, one might prioritize some over others. For instance, in an academic context, the research extensions (like improving retrieval or integrating feedback) might be most interesting. In a product context, user experience improvements (multi-turn chat, multi-language) could be more immediately valuable.

In summary, the Local RAG system we've built is a solid foundation, and these future directions show that there's plenty of scope to extend its capabilities. By addressing these, the system could become more versatile, accurate, and user-friendly, potentially evolving from a prototype into a production-grade solution or an advanced research platform for retrieval-augmented generation techniques.

In this final section, we provide supplementary material that supports the main content of the document. This includes a glossary of technical terms, a list of figures and tables used in the documentation, and a bibliography of references for further reading and verification of information.

### **Appendix A: Glossary of Terms**

* **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** An approach in AI that combines information retrieval with text generation. The system first fetches relevant data (e.g., documents) for a query and then uses a language model to generate an answer grounded in that data.

* **Embedding (Vector Embedding):** A numerical representation of data (such as text) in a high-dimensional space. Similar pieces of text have vectors that are close to each other in this space. Used for measuring semantic similarity between texts.

* **Vector Database:** A database optimized for storing and querying vectors (embeddings). It enables similarity search – finding the nearest vectors to a given query vector. Pgvector is an extension that adds this capability to PostgreSQL.

* **Similarity Search (Semantic Search):** The process of finding data that is semantically related to a query by comparing embedding vectors. Unlike keyword search, it can match concepts even if exact words differ.

* **Transformer:** A type of neural network architecture known for its self-attention mechanism. Transformers power modern language models (e.g., BERT, GPT) and can generate context-aware embeddings and text.

* **LLM (Large Language Model):** A very large Transformer-based model trained on massive text corpora. It can generate human-like text. Examples include OpenAI’s GPT-3/GPT-4, Google’s Gemini, and open models like DeepSeek LLM.

* **Cohere:** An AI platform offering NLP models via API. In our project, Cohere’s embedding API converts text into vectors capturing semantic meaning.

* **Google Gemini API:** Google’s service for their Pathways Language Model, accessible to developers. We use it as one option to generate answers from provided context.

* **DeepSeek LLM:** An open-source large language model (available in 7B and 67B parameter versions) noted for high performance in reasoning tasks. We integrate it as a local model for answering queries without external API calls.

* **FastAPI:** A modern Python web framework for building APIs quickly and efficiently. It provides features like automatic documentation and async support, used for our backend server.

* **pgvector:** A PostgreSQL extension that introduces a vector data type and similarity search operators. It allows Postgres to function as a vector database, used to store and query text embeddings in our system.

* **IVFFLAT (Index):** An algorithm for approximate nearest neighbor search. In pgvector, an IVFFLAT index partitions vectors into clusters for faster search at slight cost to exact accuracy. We use it to speed up similarity queries.

* **OCR (Optical Character Recognition):** Technology to convert images of text (scans, photos) into actual text characters. Not implemented in our project, but mentioned as a future improvement for ingesting scanned documents.

* **Cosine Similarity:** A metric that measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors. Ranges from -1 to 1, where 1 means vectors are identical in direction (i.e., very similar in meaning). Often used in embedding comparisons (pgvector uses an operator `<->` for distance based on cosine or Euclidean).

* **Pydantic:** A Python library for data validation. Used by FastAPI to define request and response schemas. Ensures input data types are correct (e.g., that a query JSON has a string field "question").

* **Docker:** A containerization platform that packages software and its dependencies into containers. We used Docker for deploying our backend, database, and optionally the frontend, ensuring consistency across environments.

* **Swagger UI / OpenAPI Docs:** Automatically generated web documentation for APIs. FastAPI generates this (the interactive docs interface) so that during development or use one can test endpoints easily.

This paper introduced the RAG concept, combining retrieval with generation. It demonstrated that augmenting a language model with a retrieved knowledge source can improve accuracy on knowledge-intensive tasks.

2. **NVIDIA Technical Blog (2023):** Rick Merritt, *"What Is Retrieval-Augmented Generation, aka RAG?"*, NVIDIA Blog, Jan 31, 2025. Provides an overview of RAG with analogies and notes the origin of the term by Patrick Lewis. It emphasizes how RAG enhances accuracy and reliability of LLMs by grounding them in external data.

3. **Cohere Documentation – RAG and Embeddings:** Cohere, *"Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)"* \[Documentation] and Cohere API Reference for *Embed*. The docs explain RAG as using external data to improve model responses, reducing hallucinations. The embedding reference defines what an embedding is (list of floats capturing semantic info) and its use in semantic search.

4. **Medium Article on Semantic Search:** Sudhir Yelikar, *"Understanding similarity or semantic search and vector databases,"* Medium, May 24, 2023. Explains how vector embeddings represent data and how similarity is calculated (with similar data having closer vectors). It outlines the process of creating embeddings for queries and doing nearest neighbor search.

5. **PostgreSQL + pgvector Introduction:** Sabrina Aquino, Qdrant Tech Blog, *"An Introduction to Vector Databases,"* Oct 09, 2024. A quote from this states, "A Vector Database is a specialized system designed to efficiently handle high-dimensional vector data... enabling similarity searches that traditional databases cannot easily perform." This justified our use of pgvector in Postgres.

6. **Pinecone Vector DB Explanation:** Roie Schwaber-Cohen, Pinecone Blog, *"What is a Vector Database & How Does it Work?"* May 3, 2023. Provides a similar definition that a vector DB indexes and stores embeddings for fast similarity search. Underlined the need for such specialized storage when dealing with AI embeddings.
